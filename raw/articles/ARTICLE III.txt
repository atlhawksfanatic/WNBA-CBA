 ARTICLE III
UNION SECURITY, DUES AND CHECK-OFF
Section 1. Membership.
As a condition of employment commencing with the execution of this Agreement,
for the duration of this Agreement only, and wherever legal: (a) any player who is or later
becomes a member in good standing of the Players Association must maintain her membership
in good standing in the Players Association; and (b) any player (including a player in the future)
who is not a member in good standing of the Players Association must, on the thirtieth (30th) day
following the beginning of her employment or the thirtieth (30th) day following the execution of
this Agreement, whichever is later, pay, pursuant to Section 2 below or otherwise, to the Players
Association an annual service fee in the same amount as any initiation fee and dues required
generally of members of the Players Association.
Section 2. Check-off.
Commencing with the execution of this Agreement and for the duration of this
Agreement only, each Team will check-off the initiation fee and annual dues, assessments or
service fees, as the case may be, in equal installments from each of the first four Regular Season
paychecks received by the player, for each player for whom a written current check-off
authorization has been provided to the Team. The Team will forward the check-off monies to
the Players Association within fourteen (14) days of each check-off, and, if the Team fails to do
so, interest at 5% per annum, payable to the Players Association, shall begin to accrue on such
check-off monies upon the conclusion of such 14-day period.
Section 3. Enforcement.
(a) Upon written notification to the WNBA by the Players Association that a
player has not paid any initiation fee, dues or the equivalent service fee in violation of Section 1
of this Article, the WNBA will raise the matter for discussion with the player and her Team. If
there is no resolution of the matter within seven (7) days, the Team will, upon the written request
of the Players Association, suspend the player without pay, wherever legal. Such suspension
will continue until the Players Association has notified the Team in writing that the suspended
player has satisfied her obligation as set forth in Section 1 of this Article. The parties hereby
agree that suspension without pay is adopted as a substitute for and in lieu of discharge as the
penalty for a violation of Section 1 above and that no player will be discharged for a violation of
that Section. A copy of all notices required by this Section will be simultaneously mailed to the
player involved and the WNBA.
(b) For purposes of this Article, a person shall be deemed to be a "member in
good standing" of the Players Association if she has made the payment of the dues or any
initiation fee (or equivalent service fee) as provided for by Section 1 above, and such status shall
not be based on any other factors involved in union discipline.
(c) Other than pursuant to Section 2 above, no Team shall pay any initiation
fees, dues, or equivalent service fee on behalf of any player.
Section 4. No Liability.
Neither the WNBA nor any Team shall be liable for any salary, bonus, or other
monetary claims that result, directly or indirectly, from a player being suspended pursuant to the
terms of Section 3 above, and the Players Association agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
WNBA and all Teams for any such claims which may be made against the WNBA and/or any
Team.
