 ARTICLE XXXVII
INTEGRATION, ENTIRE AGREEMENT,
INTERPRETATION AND CHOICE OF LAW
Section 1. Integration, Entire Agreement.
This Agreement, together with the exhibits hereto, constitutes the entire
understanding between the parties and all understandings, conversations and communications,
proposals, and counterproposals, oral and written (including any draft of this Agreement)
between the WNBA and the Players Association, or on behalf of them, are merged into and
superseded by this Agreement and shall be of no force or effect, except as expressly provided
herein. No such understandings, conversations, communications, proposals, counterproposals or
drafts shall be referred to in any proceeding by the parties. Further, no understanding contained
in this Agreement shall be modified, altered or amended, except by a writing signed by the party
against whom enforcement is sought.
Section 2. Interpretation.
The WNBA and Players Association recognize that this Agreement is separate
and distinct from the collective bargaining agreement now in effect between the National
Basketball Association ("NBA") and the National Basketball Players Association ("NBPA"),
and intend for this Agreement to be interpreted without reference to the NBA/NBPA collective
bargaining agreement (or to any other current, prior or future agreement between the NBA or
NBA Properties, Inc., on the one hand, and the NBPA on the other), to any Uniform Player
Contract entered into pursuant to the current or any prior or future collective bargaining
agreement between the NBA and the NBPA, to any of the provisions of such agreements or
Contracts, to any judicial, arbitral, or administrative decision interpreting any of the foregoing, or
to the fact that a subject was not or is not covered by or included in any such agreements or
Contracts. Accordingly, the parties agree that they will make no reference to any such
agreements, Contracts, or decisions, or to the fact that a particular provision was not or is not
included in any such agreement or Contract, or to any practice or policy of the NBA (or NBA
Properties, Inc.) or the NBPA, in any arbitral, judicial, administrative, or other proceeding,
including, without limitation, proceedings brought under Articles XXII and XXIII of this
Agreement. The parties further agree that no such agreement, Contract, provision (or absence of
provisions), decision, practice, or policy may be relied upon by any decision maker in such
proceedings.
Section 3. Choice of Law.
This Agreement (including all Exhibits hereto) is made under and shall be
governed by the internal law of the State of New York, except where federal law may govern.
