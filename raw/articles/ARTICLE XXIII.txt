UNDER ARTICLES VI, VII, XII, XIII, XV, AND XVI
Section 1. Authority of Arbitrator.
Disputes involving the interpretation of, application of, or compliance with
Article VI, Article VII, Article XII, XIII, Article XV, and Article XVI shall be resolved by the
Arbitrator appointed pursuant to the provisions of Article XXII, Section 4(b), exclusively in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this Article XXIII.
Section 2. Initiation.
(a) Either the WNBA or the Players Association may initiate a proceeding
under this Article by filing a written notice thereof with the Arbitrator and serving a copy of such
notice on the other party. Except as otherwise provided by Article XVI, Section 5, a proceeding
under this Article may be initiated only by the WNBA or the Players Association.
(b) A proceeding under this Article must be initiated within ninety (90) days
from the date of the act or omission upon which the claim asserted is based, or within ninety (90)
days from the date upon which such act or omission became known or reasonably should have
become known to the party initiating the proceeding, whichever is later.
Section 3. Procedures.
(a) All matters before the Arbitrator under this Article shall be heard and
determined in an expedited manner, provided that such expedition is reasonable under the
circumstances. A proceeding under this Article may be commenced upon seventy-two (72)
hours' written notice (or upon shorter notice if ordered by the Arbitrator) served upon the party
against whom the proceeding is brought and filed with the Arbitrator. All such notices and all
orders and notices issued and directed by the Arbitrator shall be served on the WNBA, counsel
for the WNBA, the Players Association, counsel for the Players Association, and any counsel
appearing for individual WNBA players or individual WNBA Teams.
(b) In proceedings under this Article, the Arbitrator shall make findings of
fact and award appropriate relief including, without limitation, damages and specific
performance. The Arbitrator shall render an award as soon as practicable, and the award shall be
accompanied by a written opinion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Arbitrator determines
that expedition so requires, the Arbitrator shall accompany the award with a written summary of
the grounds upon which the award is based, and a full written opinion may follow within a
reasonable time thereafter. In no event shall the award and written opinion be issued more than
thirty (30) days following the date upon which the record of the proceeding is closed (or, where
applicable, the date designated by the Arbitrator for the submission of post-hearing briefs).
(c) In proceedings under this Article, the Arbitrator shall have authority to
order the production of documents, the conduct of pre-hearing depositions, and the attendance of
witnesses at the hearing with respect to the WNBA and the Players Association, and/or any
player or Team. The Arbitrator shall have the authority to compel the attendance of witnesses
and the production of documents at any hearing within the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator in
accordance with the New York C.P.L.R.
(d) An award of the Arbitrator under this Article shall, upon its issuance,
constitute the full, final and complete disposition of the dispute and shall be binding upon the
parties to this Agreement and upon any player(s) or Team(s) involved.
(e) The Arbitrator shall not have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract
from, or alter in any way the provisions of this Agreement or any Player Contract.
Section 4. Special Procedure for Disputes with Respect to a Players Association Review
of a League Revenue Report.
(a) Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Agreement, at the
request of either the WNBA or the Players Association, and irrespective of which party may
commence the proceeding, the procedures set forth in this Section 4 shall apply to the resolution
of any disputes with respect to a Players Association review of a League Revenue Report in
accordance with Article XII. If in connection with any such dispute, there is any conflict
between the procedures set forth in this Section 4 and those set forth elsewhere in this
Agreement, the procedures set forth in this Section shall control.
(b) With respect to a Players Association review of a League Revenue Report,
a proceeding before the Arbitrator shall be commenced, in the manner provided for by Section
2(a) of this Article XXIII, no more than twenty (20) days following the April 30 of the calendar
year following the conclusion of the Season that was the subject of the review.
(c) A party's failure to commence a proceeding before the Arbitrator within
the time period provided for by subsection (b) above shall forever bar that party from asserting or
seeking relief of any kind with respect to a Players Association review of a League Revenue
Report for the applicable Season.
(d) In proceedings commenced pursuant to this Section 4, the Arbitrator shall
conduct the hearing within fifteen (15) days from the commencement of the proceeding and shall
render an award and issue a written decision as soon as possible, but in no event later than ten
(10) days following the close of the hearing.
(e) No dispute shall proceed to a hearing under this Section 4 unless the
amount of League Revenue in dispute would create a Net Overage (as those terms are defined in
Article XII, Section 1(b)).
Section 5. Costs.
(a) The compensation of the Arbitrator and the costs and expenses incurred in
connection with any proceeding brought before the Arbitrator under this Article shall be borne
equally by the parties to this Agreement; provided, however, that each participant in such
proceeding shall bear its own attorneys' fees and litigation costs.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 5(a) above, if a matter is
scheduled for hearing under this Article XXIII, and the hearing date is thereafter postponed at the
request of either the WBNA or the Players Association, the postponement fee (if any) of the
Arbitrator will be borne by the party requesting the postponement unless the party objects and
the Arbitrator finds that the request for such postponement was for good cause. Should good
cause be found, the parties will share any postponement fee equally.
