OLYMPIC HIATUS
The following rules shall apply to any Season for which the WNBA, in its sole
discretion, elects to adjust the Regular Season schedule of games to permit players to participate
in the Olympic Games:
(a) The WNBA shall determine, within its sole discretion, the period of time
during such Regular Season that shall not include any WNBA games (a "Hiatus");
(b) Players not participating in the Olympic Games shall be entitled to a
vacation of seven (7) consecutive days (the "Vacation Period") to commence either: (i) the first
day following such player's last game before a Hiatus or, if such game is on the road, the first
day back in the Team's home city (the "Early Vacation"); or (ii) the fifth (5th) day following
such player's last game before a Hiatus (the "Late Vacation"). Approximately half of the players
on a Team will take the Early Vacation and the remaining players will take the Late Vacation.
The determination as to which players will take the Early Vacation and which players will take
the Late Vacation will be made prior to the conclusion of the training camp held for the Regular
Season that includes a Hiatus by the Team in consultation with its players;
(c) Teams and players may voluntarily negotiate marketing agreements that
would require players to remain in the Team's home city during all or part of the player's
Vacation Period and perform marketing-related services for the Team (e.g., player appearances),
provided that (i) the compensation to be paid to the player pursuant to such marketing agreement
must be at least \$125 per day but may not exceed \$300 per day and (ii) any appearances made by
the player pursuant to such marketing agreement will not count as an appearance pursuant to
Article XXIV or Article XXVI of this Agreement (a "Hiatus Marketing Agreement");
228week and no such practice may exceed three (3) hours in length, or four (4) hours in length if
such practice includes film or conditioning activities;
(e) Except during a Vacation Period, Teams shall be required to pay players a
daily per diem of fifty-five dollars (\$55) during a Hiatus. In addition, players who have agreed
to remain in the Team's home city during a Vacation Period pursuant to a Hiatus Marketing
Agreement shall receive a daily per diem of fifty-five dollars (\$55) during the term of such
Hiatus Marketing Agreement.
(f) The Mid Point of any Regular Season during which there is a Hiatus shall
be calculated by dividing the total number of calendar days in such Regular Season (not
including the Hiatus) by two (2) and adding that number to the first day of such Regular Season.
If the number that results from dividing the number of days in the Regular Season by two (2) is
not a whole number, the number used to calculate the Mid Point shall be determined by rounding
up to the nearest whole number;
(g) The Minimum Player Salary for Rest-of-Season Contracts will be the
Minimum Annual Salary called for under Article V, Section 7 multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which is the total number of days left in the Regular Season less (i) the number of
days in the Hiatus for Contracts entered into prior to the commencement of the Hiatus, (ii) the
number of days remaining in the Hiatus for Contracts entered into during the Hiatus, or (iii) zero
(0) for Contracts entered into after the Hiatus, and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the Regular Season (not including the Hiatus);
(h) The Maximum Player Salary for Rest-of-Season Contracts will be the
Maximum Player Salary called for under Article V, Section 8 multiplied by a fraction, the
229days in the Hiatus for Contracts entered into prior to the commencement of the Hiatus, (ii) the
number of days remaining in the Hiatus for Contracts entered into during the Hiatus, or (iii) zero
(0) for Contracts entered into after the Hiatus, and the denominator of which is the number of
days in the Regular Season (not including the Hiatus);
(i) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Article XXIV of this
Agreement, one (1) promotional appearance made by each player during a Hiatus shall not count
as an appearance under Article XXIV or Article XXVI of this Agreement, and no player shall be
required to participate in more than one (1) promotional appearance during a Hiatus that exceeds
four (4) hours in length (excluding travel time);
(j) All players will be paid their Base Salary in nine (9) equal, semi-monthly
installments in any Season that includes a Hiatus, beginning on or about June 1 and ending on or
about September 30; and
(k) In the event that no All-Star Game is held during any Season that includes
a Hiatus, the WNBA and the Players Association shall agree in good faith on how to re-allocate
the bonus money that would have been paid (e.g., by increasing the First and Second Team All-
WNBA bonuses for that year) to players named to the All-Star team (but not to players who may
have earned All-Star-related bonuses such as those related to any skills competition).
