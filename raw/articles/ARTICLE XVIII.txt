OFF-SEASON PLAY
Subject to Article XIV, Section 9, a player is free to play competitive basketball
for any other professional basketball league during the Off-Season, provided that: (i) the player's
Off-Season Playing Obligation does not interfere with any of her playing obligations under her
Standard Player Contract (including any obligation contained in any Exhibit 8), or any of her
other obligations under any WNBA or Team Marketing and Promotional Agreement or this
Agreement; and (ii) the player provides prompt notice to the WNBA and/or her Team (as the
case may be) in writing of her Off-Season Playing Obligation prior to the conclusion of the
Regular Season that precedes the applicable Off-Season or as soon as possible thereafter. All
Off-Season Playing Obligations (or summaries of such Off-Season Playing Obligations
containing all material terms) must be filed with the WNBA League Office prior to the time that
the player renders any services pursuant to such Off-Season Playing Obligations, provided,
however, that the player may redact any financial term from such Off-Season Playing
Obligations.
