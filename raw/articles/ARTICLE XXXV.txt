 ARTICLE XXXV
PROVISIONS WITH RESPECT TO CANADIAN EMPLOYMENT
Section 1. WNBA Team in Canada.
If at any time during the term of this Agreement a WNBA Team is based in
Canada, the following provisions will apply to all players employed by any such team:
(a) To the extent practicable, the terms of the WNBA 401(k) Plan shall permit
participation by players with respect to employment in Canada on a tax-effective basis under
Canadian income tax laws. If the WNBA and the Players Association determine that the 401(k)
Plan cannot be provided on a tax-effective basis under Canadian income tax law, an alternative
arrangement relating to employment in Canada, which is acceptable to both the WNBA and the
Players Association, shall be established in lieu of the 401(k) Plan.
(b) The bases upon which a player may be disciplined or discharged or a
Player Contract terminated, as set forth in this Agreement and/or in the Standard Player Contract,
shall constitute just and reasonable cause within the meaning of any applicable Canadian statute
(federal or provincial).
(c) During the term of this Agreement, the WNBA and the Players
Association shall consult regularly about issues relating to the workplace which affect the parties
or any player bound by this Agreement.
(d) (i) If and to the extent Sections 48 and 49 of the Ontario Labour
Relations Act (or other statutes of like import in other Canadian provinces) are or may be found
applicable to this Agreement, the parties agree that the provisions thereof shall apply only to
disputes between a WNBA Team located in Ontario (or such other province(s) as the case may
be) and players employed by such Team(s).
 If and to the extent Section 84(2) of the British Columbia Labour
Relations Code (or other statutes of like import in other Canadian provinces) is or may be found
applicable to this Agreement, the parties agree that the provisions thereof shall apply only to
disputes between a WNBA Team based in British Columbia (or such other province(s) as the
case may be) and players employed by such Team.
(e) The parties acknowledge and agree that a player employed pursuant to the
provisions of a Standard Player Contract, Rest-of-Season Contract, 7-Day Contract, or a
Replacement Contact is and/or shall be deemed to be an employee hired "on the basis that her
employment is to terminate on the expiry of a definite term or the completion of a specific task"
within the meaning of paragraph 1 of Section 2(1) of Ontario Regulation 288/01, made under the
Ontario Employment Standards Act, 2000 (or other statutes or regulations of like import in other
Canadian provinces) and an "employee employed for a definite term" within the meaning of
Section 65(1)(b) of the British Columbia Employment Standards Act (or other statutes of like
import in other Canadian provinces), so as to render inapplicable to WNBA players the
provisions of Sections 54-62 of the Ontario Employment Standards Act, 2000 and Sections 63
and 64 of the British Columbia Employment Standards Act (or other statutes of like import in
other Canadian provinces).
(f) The parties acknowledge and agree that the severance benefits provided to
players pursuant to this Agreement (i.e., the provisions of Player Contracts that may provide, in
certain circumstances, for the continued payment of Base Salary to a player following the
termination of a Player Contract) constitute and/or shall be deemed to constitute a settlement
binding on the player within the meaning of Section 6 of the Ontario Employment Standards Act,
2000 (or other statutes of like import in other Canadian provinces) and/or "an amount paid to an
employee for loss of employment under a provision of the employment contract based upon
length of employment, length of service or seniority" within the meaning of Section 65(8)2 of
the Ontario Employment Standards Act, 2000 (or other statutes of like import in other Canadian
provinces), so as to render inapplicable to WNBA players the provisions of Section 63-66 of
such Act (or other statutes of like import in other Canadian provinces).
(g) Upon the WNBA's request, the Players Association shall cooperate with
the WNBA in a reasonable manner in connection with any effort the WNBA may make to seek
an exemption from any Canadian (federal or provincial) law or regulation affecting the
employment relationship that is inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or any other
agreement between the Players Association and the WNBA.
(h) The parties hereby specifically exclude the operation of subsections (2)
and (3) of Section 50 of the British Columbia Labour Relations Code (and other statutes of like
import in other Canadian provinces).
(i) All players employed by a WNBA Team shall be paid in U.S. dollars,
regardless of where the Team by which such player is employed is based.
