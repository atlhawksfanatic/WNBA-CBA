 ARTICLE XV
CIRCUMVENTION
Section 1. General Prohibitions.
(a) It is the intention of the parties that the provisions agreed to herein,
including, without limitation, those relating to the Salary Cap, the Exceptions to the Salary Cap,
the Rookie Scale, and free agency, be interpreted so as to preserve the essential benefits achieved
by both parties to this Agreement. Neither the Players Association or the WNBA, nor any Team
(or Team Affiliate) or player (or person or entity acting with authority on behalf of such player),
shall enter into any agreement (including, without limitation, any Player Contract, Team
Marketing and Promotional Agreement, or any amendment or extension thereof), or undertake
any action or transaction (including, without limitation, the assignment or termination of a Player
Contract), which is, or which includes any term that is, designed to serve the purpose of
defeating or circumventing the intention of the parties as reflected by all of the provisions of this
Agreement.
(b) It shall constitute a violation of Section 1(a) above for a Team (or Team
Affiliate) to enter into an agreement or understanding with any sponsor or business partner or
third party under which such sponsor, business partner or third party pays or agrees to pay
compensation for basketball services (even if such compensation is ostensibly designated as
being for non-basketball services) to a player under Contract to the Team. Such an agreement
with a sponsor or business partner or third party may be inferred where: (i) such compensation
from the sponsor or business partner or third party is substantially in excess of the fair market
value of any services to be rendered by the player for such sponsor or business partner or third
party; and (ii) the Compensation in the Player Contract between the player and the Team is
substantially below the fair market value of such Contract.
 (c) It shall constitute a violation of Section 1(a) above for a Team (or Team
Affiliate) to have a financial arrangement with or offer a financial inducement to any player (not
including retired players) not signed to a current Player Contract, except as permitted by this
Agreement.
Section 2. No Unauthorized Agreements.
(a) At no time shall there be any agreements or transactions of any kind
(whether disclosed or undisclosed to the WNBA), express or implied, oral or written, or
promises, undertakings, representations, commitments, inducements, assurances of intent, or
understandings of any kind (whether disclosed or undisclosed to the WNBA), between a player
(or any person or entity controlled by, related to, or acting with authority on behalf of such
player) and any Team (or Team Affiliate):
concerning any future extension or amendment of an existing
Standard Player Contract or Team Marketing and Promotional Agreement, or entry into a new
Standard Player Contract or Team Marketing and Promotional Agreement; or
except as permitted by this Agreement or as set forth in a Standard
Player Contract (provided that the Team has not intentionally delayed submitting such Standard
Player Contract for approval by the WNBA) or Team Marketing and Promotional Agreement,
involving compensation or consideration of any kind or anything else of value to be paid,
furnished or made available by, to, or for the benefit of the player, or any person or entity
controlled by, related to, or acting with authority on behalf of the player; or
except as permitted by this Agreement, involving an investment or
business opportunity to be furnished or made available by, to, or for the benefit of the player, or
any person or entity controlled by, related to, or acting with authority on behalf of the player.
 (b) In addition to the foregoing, it shall be a violation of this Section 2 for any
Team (or Team Affiliate) or any player (or any person or entity controlled by, related to, or
acting with authority on behalf of such player) to attempt to enter into or to solicit any
agreement, transaction, promise, undertaking, representation, commitment, inducement,
assurance of intent or understanding that would be prohibited by Section 2(a) above.
(c) A violation of Section 2(a) or 2(b) above may be proven by direct or
circumstantial evidence, including, but not limited to, evidence that a Standard Player Contract
or Team Marketing and Promotional Agreement, or any term or provision thereof, cannot
rationally be explained in the absence of conduct violative of Section 2(a) or 2(b). The foregoing
sentence shall not limit the nature or character of the evidence that may be proffered or that,
consistent with any applicable rules of evidence, may be admitted in any proceeding conducted
in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Agreement.
(d) In any proceeding brought before the Arbitrator pursuant to this Section 2,
no adverse inference shall be drawn against the party initiating such proceeding because that
party, when it first suspected or believed that a violation of Section 2 may have occurred,
deferred the initiation of such proceeding until it had further reason to believe that such a
violation had occurred.
(e) A player will not be found to have committed a violation of Section
2(a)(ii) above if the violation is the Team's intentional delay in submitting a Standard Player
Contract to the WNBA and this was done without the player's knowledge.
Section 3. Diversity in Coaching Initiative.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 1 and Section 2 above and consistent
with the "WNBA's Diversity in Coaching Initiative," it shall not be considered a violation of
Section 1 or Section 2 above if a Team Affiliate hires a player to perform Off-Season basketball
coaching or basketball operations services for a team not in the WNBA; provided that: (i) the
player has at least eight (8) Years of Service in the WNBA and three (3) Years of Service with
the Team affiliated with the Team Affiliate at the time of the of the agreement between the Team
Affiliate and the player; (ii) the player provides the coaching/basketball operations services on a
full-time basis during the Off-Season; (iii) the agreement between the player and the Team
Affiliate is in no way connected to the signing of any Player Contract (including any amendment
to that Player Contract or Extension of that Player Contract); (iv) the compensation to be
received by the player from the Team Affiliate represents the fair market value of the services to
be performed, as determined by the WNBA, prorated as necessary to reflect the number of
months in the Off-Season when the player will be providing the full-time services; and (v) the
agreement in its entirety is approved by the WNBA within its sole discretion (a "Diversity in
Coaching Initiative Employment Arrangement"). The factors to be considered by the WNBA in
connection with its decision whether or not to approve a Diversity in Coaching Initiative
Employment Arrangement will include, but not be limited to: (i) whether the agreement serves to
frustrate the essential benefits of this Collective Bargaining Agreement, including those related
to the Salary Cap and free agency; (ii) the timing of the agreement and whether the compensation
to be received by the player could in any way be considered to be in lieu of compensation under
a Player Contract and/or an enticement to sign a Player Contract; and (iii) the connection
between the services to be performed, the basketball operations needs of the Team Affiliate, and
the post-playing career aspirations of the player.
Section 4. Penalties.
(a) If the Arbitrator finds a violation of Section 1 above, the Commissioner
shall be authorized to:
impose a fine of up to \$300,000 (50% of which shall be payable to
the WNBA, and 50% of which shall be payable to the Players Association – Selected Charitable
Organization) on any Team found to have committed such violation for the first time;
impose a fine of up to \$500,000 (50% of which shall be payable to
the WNBA, and 50% of which shall be payable to the Players Association – Selected Charitable
Organization) on any Team found to have committed such violation for at least the second time;
direct the forfeiture of one first round draft pick;
void any Standard Player Contract or Team Marketing and
Promotional Agreement (or any extension or amendment thereof) between any player and any
Team when both the player (or any person or entity acting with authority on behalf of such
player) and the Team (or Team Affiliate) are found to have committed such violation; and/or
void any other transaction or agreement found to have violated
Section 1 above.
(b) If the Arbitrator finds a violation of Section 2 above, the Commissioner
shall be authorized to:
impose a fine of up to \$1,000,000 on any Team found to have
committed such violation (50% of which shall be payable to the WNBA, and 50% of which shall
be payable to the Players Association – Selected Charitable Organization);
direct the forfeiture of draft picks;
 when both the player (or any person or entity acting with authority
on behalf of such player) and the Team (or Team Affiliate) are found to have committed such
violation, (A) void any Player Contract and/or Team Marketing Promotional Agreement (or any
extension, or amendment thereof) between such player and such Team, (B) impose a fine of up
to \$2,000 on any player (50% of which shall be payable to the WNBA, and 50% of which shall
be payable to the WNBA – Selected Charitable Organization, and/or (C) prohibit any future
Player Contract and/or Team Marketing Promotional Agreement (or any extension or
amendment thereof) between such player and such Team;
suspend for up to one (1) year any person (other than a player)
employed by, or otherwise rendering services for, the Team found to have willfully engaged in
such violation; and/or
void any transaction or agreement found to have violated Section 2
above and direct the disgorgement by the player of anything of value received in connection with
such transaction or agreement (except compensation received for services already performed
pursuant to a Player Contract), unless the player establishes by a preponderance of the evidence
that she was unaware of the violation.
(c) In any proceeding before the Arbitrator in which it is alleged that a player
agent or other person or entity acting with authority on behalf of a player has violated Section 2
above, the Arbitrator shall make a specific determination with respect to such allegation and
shall refer such finding to the Players Association. The Players Association shall accept as
binding and conclusive the finding(s) of the Arbitrator that a violation of Section 2(a) or 2(b) has
occurred and shall consider such finding(s) as establishing a violation of the Players
Association's regulations applicable to such person or entity. The Players Association represents
that it will impose such discipline as is appropriate under the circumstances on the person or
entity found to have violated Section 2 above, and that it will promptly notify the WNBA of the
discipline imposed; provided, however, that in no event shall the penalty imposed upon a player
agent found to have violated Section 2 above be less than a one (1)-year suspension of that
player agent's certification by the Players Association.
Section 5. Production of Tax Materials.
In any proceeding to enforce Section 1 or 2 above, the Arbitrator shall have the
authority, upon good cause shown, to direct any Team, Team Affiliate, or player to produce any
tax returns or other relevant tax materials disclosing income figures for the player (non-income
figures may be redacted), or disclosing expense figures by the Team or Team Affiliate (non-
expense figures may be redacted), which materials shall not be released to the general public or
the media and shall be treated as strictly confidential by all parties.
Section 6. Transactions with Retired Players.
(a) If (i) a Team or Team Affiliate enters into a transaction after the date of
this Agreement with a retired player who played for the Team within the five-year (5) period
preceding such transaction and the terms of such transaction provide for the retired player to be
compensated in excess of \$10,000 or to be provided with an investment or business opportunity,
and if (ii) the compensation the retired player received from the Team when she was a player was
substantially below the then fair market value of such player's basketball services, then the
WNBA may challenge the transaction, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 6(b) below,
on the ground that: (A) the compensation to the retired player substantially exceeds the then fair
market value of the services or other consideration provided by the retired player in the
transaction; or that (B) the amount of the retired player's investment or the benefit conferred
upon the retired player as a result of the investment or business opportunity is not commercially
reasonable, given the relative risks and rewards of such investment.
(b) Any challenge under this Section 6 shall be filed in writing with a business
valuation expert jointly selected by the WNBA and the Players Association. In the event that the
parties cannot agree on the identity of a business valuation expert, a business valuation expert
shall be selected in the same manner set forth in Article XXII, Section 4 for the selection of an
arbitrator in the absence of an agreement between the parties. The business valuation expert
shall conduct a hearing in which the player or retired player, the Team and/or Team Affiliate, the
Players Association, and the WNBA are afforded the opportunity to appear and participate. The
WNBA shall have the burden of proof in the proceeding. The business valuation expert may
permit discovery of relevant documents necessary to undertake the valuation, and shall render a
decision within fifteen (15) days following the conclusion of the hearing. Within ten (10) days
of any decision by the business valuation expert, any of the parties may file an appeal with the
Arbitrator, who shall conduct a hearing and render a decision within twenty (20) days of the
filing of the appeal. In any such proceeding, the Arbitrator shall apply an "arbitrary and
capricious" standard of review.
(c) If the WNBA prevails in its challenge under this Section 6, the difference
between (A) the compensation received by the retired player, or the value of the investment or
business opportunity received by the retired player (net of any contribution by the retired player),
and (B) a reasonable estimate of the fair market value of the services or other consideration
provided by the retired player, or a reasonable estimate of the fair market value of the investment
or business opportunity, in each case as determined by the business valuation expert or the
Arbitrator, as the case may be, shall be included in the Team's Team Salary, subject to the
Team's Room and other Salary Cap rules, and further subject to any allocation over time that the
business valuation expert or Arbitrator determines is appropriate. In the event that any amount
required to be included in the Team Salary pursuant to this subsection exceeds the Team's
Room, the challenged transaction or arrangement shall be rescinded and of no further force and
effect.
(d) If the WNBA prevails in its challenge under this Section 6, and the retired
player and the Team and/or Team Affiliate renegotiate or terminate the transaction, any revised
terms of the transaction shall be promptly disclosed to the WNBA and the Players Association,
and may, at the request of the WNBA, be re-subjected to the procedures of this Section 6.
Any information disclosed to the League Office and the Players Association
pursuant to the procedures of this Section 6 shall be treated strictly confidential, and shall not be
released to the general public or the media.
