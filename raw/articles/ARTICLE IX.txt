MERIT BONUSES
Section 1. Payment of Merit Bonuses.
During each Season covered by this Agreement, the WNBA and/or the Teams
shall pay the merit bonuses set forth in Section 2 below. To be eligible to earn a Team bonus, a
player must be on the Regular Season roster of the applicable Team on the last day of the
Regular Season; provided, however, that any player who was on the Regular Season roster for
two-thirds of the Regular Season games for a Team that makes the playoffs, but not on the
Regular Season roster on the last day of the Regular Season for any Team, shall receive a two
hundred and fifty dollar (\$250) bonus. If a player who is eligible to earn a Team bonus was not
on the active or inactive list of such Team for the entirety of the Regular Season, any bonus paid
to such player shall be prorated based upon the number of days of the Regular Season that such
player was on the active or inactive list of such Team for such Season.
