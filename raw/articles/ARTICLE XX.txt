 ARTICLE XX
PHYSICAL CONDITION, MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS AND INJURIES
Section 1. Medical Examination, Supply of Information, and Fitness of Player.
(a) Upon the signing of a Standard Player Contract and during each training
camp, a player shall submit to a complete medical examination by a physician designated by the
Team (the "Physician"). Upon the signing of a Standard Player Contract, and upon the request
of the Team, a player shall provide a complete prior medical history (including medical records).
In addition, a player shall provide a complete prior medical history (including medical records)
related to any injury sustained (or condition aggravated) while performing basketball-related
services in connection with an Off-Season Playing Obligation or for an entity (e.g., national
team) other than the WNBA (an "Other Team/Entity Basketball Injury"). A player shall supply
complete and truthful information in response to questions posed to her with respect to her
physical and mental condition in connection with any medical examinations or requests for
medical information authorized by this Agreement (it being agreed that only questions
reasonable and medically appropriate may be posed). With respect to any pre-season medical
examination, the WNBA shall provide copies to the Players Association of any standard
questionnaires and written testing protocols used by the Physician. In the event that the Players
Association identifies any questions or tests that in its opinion lack probative value given the
purpose of the examination, the parties will select an expert in women's health and sports
medicine (or, if unable to agree on an expert, the Medical Director) to review the questions
and/or tests in question and advise the WNBA and the Players Association as to the probative
value of the questions and/or tests in question. Neither the Players Association's review, nor any
review conducted by a women's health expert or the Medical Director, of a Physician's standard
questionnaires and written testing protocols shall delay the administration of any pre-season
physical examination or obviate a player's obligation to supply complete and truthful
information in response to questions posed to her.
(b) If the Physician determines that a player is not completely and
unqualifiedly fit to perform all basketball-related services required of the player under this
Agreement or her Standard Player Contract for reasons other than an Other Team/Entity
Basketball Injury, the Team shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend such player
without pay until such time as, in the judgment of the Physician, the player is in sufficiently good
physical condition to play skilled basketball. In the event of such suspension, the Base Salary
payable to the player for any WNBA Season during which such suspension occurs shall be
reduced by an amount equal to her full Base Salary multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the number of days of the Regular Season missed as a consequence of the
suspension, and the denominator of which shall be the number of days in such Regular Season;
provided, however, that the foregoing calculation shall not result in the reduction of a player's
Base Salary in an amount greater than such Base Salary.
(c) If the Physician determines that a player is not completely and
unqualifiedly fit to perform all basketball-related services required of the player under this
Agreement or her Standard Player Contract as a result of an Other Team/Entity Basketball
Injury, the Team shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to suspend such player without pay:
(i) until such time as, in the judgment of the Physician, the player is in sufficiently good physical
condition to play skilled basketball; or (ii) if the Physician determines that such lack of fitness
will last beyond the first forty-two (42) days of the Season (or beyond the first twenty-eight (28)
days of the Season in the event that such lack of fitness is due at least in part to a "Timed
Medical Treatment"), for the entire upcoming Season. In the event of such suspension, the Base
Salary payable to the player for any WNBA Season during which such suspension occurs shall
be reduced by an amount equal to her full Base Salary multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of
which shall be the number of days of the Regular Season missed as a consequence of the
suspension, and the denominator of which shall be the total number of days in such Regular
Season; provided, however, that the foregoing calculation shall not result in the reduction of a
player's Base Salary in an amount greater than such Base Salary. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary herein, any player suspended pursuant to this Section 1(c) shall continue to receive
health benefits pursuant to Article X for the duration of such suspension. For clarity, any dispute
between a Team and a player regarding any suspension imposed pursuant to this Section 1(c)
shall be resolved pursuant to the Grievance and Arbitration procedures contained within Article
XXII, including, if applicable, through an Expedited Hearing. For the purposes of this
subparagraph (c), a "Timed Medical Treatment" is medical treatment undergone by a player, or a
postponement of, or declining to obtain, medical treatment, that is reasonably understood from a
timing standpoint to reflect the player's prioritization of an Off-Season Playing Obligation or
basketball-related service for an entity (e.g., national team) other than the WNBA over the
playing services required pursuant to such player's Standard Player Contract.
Section 2. Notice and Treatment.
(a) A player shall promptly notify the Team's coach, trainer or physician of
any illness, injury or condition contracted or suffered by her which may impair or otherwise
affect her ability to play skilled basketball, including, if known, the time, place, cause and nature
of such illness, injury or condition.
 (b) Should a player suffer an injury or illness during the term of her Standard
Player Contract, she shall submit to a medical examination and treatment by a physician
designated by the Team, and such rehabilitation activities as such physician may specify. Such
examination and treatment when made at the request of the Team shall be paid for by the Team,
unless such examination and/or treatment is made necessary by some act or conduct of the player
contrary to the terms of this Agreement or her Standard Player Contract.
(c) A player may be subject to reasonable discipline if, without reasonable
justification, she misses any required medical appointment or fails to follow rehabilitation and/or
treatment instructions from a physician designated by the Team.
Section 3. Disclosure of Medical or Health Information.
(a) A Team physician may disclose all relevant medical information
concerning a player to (i) the General Manager, coaches, and trainers of the Team by which such
player is employed, (ii) any entity from which any such Team seeks to procure, or has procured,
an insurance policy covering such player's life or any disability, injury or illness such player may
suffer or sustain, and (iii) subject to the terms of Section 3(e) below, the media or public on
behalf of the Team.
(b) Should a Team contemplate the assignment of a player's Standard Player
Contract to one or more WNBA teams, the Team's physician may furnish to the physicians and
General Manager, coaches, and trainers of such other team or teams (and any entity from which
such other team or teams seeks to procure, or has procured, an insurance policy covering such
player's life or any disability, injury or illness such player may suffer or sustain) all relevant
medical information relating to the player.
 (c) Subject to Section 10 below, a player who consults or is treated by a
physician (including a psychiatrist) or a professional providing non-mental-health-related
medical services (e.g., chiropractor, physical therapist) other than such player's Team physician
or other professional designated by the Team shall give notice of such consultation or treatment
to her Team's physician and shall provide her Team with all information it may request
concerning any condition that, in the judgment of Team's physician, may affect such player's
ability to play skilled basketball. No Team shall discourage a player from seeking such a
consultation.
(d) Subject to subsection (e) below, each Team may make public medical
information relating to the players in its employ, provided that such information relates solely to
the reasons why any such player has not been or is not rendering services as a player.
(e) A player or her immediate family (where appropriate) shall have the right
to approve the substance, terms, and timing of any public release of medical information relating
to any injuries or illnesses suffered by that player that are potentially life- or career-threatening,
or that do not arise from the player's participation in WNBA games or practices.
(f) If and to the extent necessary to enable or facilitate the disclosure of
medical or health information as provided for by this Section 3, a player shall execute such
individual authorization(s) as may be requested by the WNBA or a Team or Teams or as may be
required by health care providers who examine or treat the player.
(g) A player is entitled to her own medical records and the Team shall use
best efforts to provide such information on or before two (2) business days of a player request.
Section 4. Insurance.
(a) If a player is injured during the performance of her duties under her
Standard Player Contract and promptly reports that injury to the Team, the Team shall pay the
player's reasonable hospitalization and medical expenses necessarily incurred as a direct result of
the injury, provided that the hospital and physicians are selected by the Team (or, if selected by
the player, approved in writing by the Team). The Team's obligation under this paragraph shall
be reduced by any applicable workers' compensation insurance (which, to the extent permitted
by law, shall be deemed as having been assigned to the Team) and any insurance paid or payable
to the player by reason of such injury.
(b) Each player shall cooperate with the Team and the WNBA regarding all
insurance matters, including, but not limited to, required medical evaluations and worker's
compensation claim requirements.
Section 5. Health Screenings.
Players shall submit to reasonable screening and baseline testing (e.g., pursuant to
WNBA cardiac and concussion protocols) and, in connection with such screening and testing,
shall accurately and completely answer all reasonable health questions (including, upon request,
providing accurate and complete medical histories).
Section 6. Electronic Medical Records.
The WNBA may, during the term of this Agreement, develop and implement a
new electronic medical records system ("EMR") that will provide a secure, searchable,
centralized database of player health information. To the extent health information disclosures
are permitted by this Agreement (including the Standard Player Contract), such disclosures may
be made via secure systems within the EMR. In addition, the EMR will: (i) allow for the WNBA
(but not the Teams) to conduct player health and safety reviews; (ii) allow for authorized
academic researchers to access the data (on a de-identified basis) and conduct studies designed to
improve player health and broaden medical knowledge (provided that the Players Association
will be provided with notice prior to any such access and gives its consent, such consent not to
be unreasonably withheld); and (iii) give players the ability to easily access their own health
information and to grant access to such information to physicians of their choice both during and
after their careers.
Section 7. Concussion Policy/Committee of Physicians.
(a) A concussion policy designed to maximize the neurological health of
players, which was developed in conjunction with a committee of Team (and other) physicians,
was implemented beginning with the 2012 Season.
(b) The concussion policy will be reviewed periodically by the committee in
order to keep it current and consistent with the evolving science of concussion management.
(c) Any committee of physicians utilized by the WNBA to establish or update
any WNBA medical protocols will include at least one physician with experience in women's
health.
Section 8. Selection of Team Physician and Other Health Care Providers.
Each Team has the sole and exclusive discretion to select any doctors, hospitals,
clinics, health consultants, or other health care providers ("Health Care Providers") to examine
and/or treat players pursuant to the terms of this Agreement and the Standard Player Contract;
provided, however, no Team will engage any Health Care Provider based primarily on a
sponsorship relationship (or lack thereof) with the Team, and without considering the Health
Care Provider's qualifications (including, e.g., medical experience and credentials) and the goal
of providing high quality care to all of its players. Each Team's Health Care Provider's primary
duty in providing medical care shall be not to the Team but instead to the player‐patient.
Section 9. Requirements for Certain Team Player Health Professionals.
(a) Each Team agrees to secure the services of at least one (1) physician as a
team physician. Beginning with the 2020 Season, each individual hired for the first time to
perform services as a Team physician must be a duly licensed physician who as of the hiring
date: (i) is board certified and fellowship trained in his/her field of medical expertise; (ii) has at
least three (3) years of post-fellowship clinical experience; and (iii) has successfully completed a
fellowship in sports medicine, has a Certification of Added Qualification (CAQ) in sports
medicine, or has other "sports medicine" qualifications as the parties may agree.
(b) Each Team agrees to secure the services of at least one (1) athletic trainer
on a full-time basis. Beginning with the 2020 Regular Season: (i) each individual hired for the
first time to perform services as an athletic trainer for a Team must as of the hiring date: (a) be
certified by the National Athletic Trainers Association (NATA) or the Canadian Athletic
Therapists Association (CATA) (or a similar organization as the parties may agree), and (b) hold
a current certification in Basic Cardiac Life Support or Basic Trauma Life Support; and (ii) each
individual hired for the first time to perform services as an athletic trainer for a Team must, as of
the hiring date, have at least three (3) years of experience as an athletic trainer since he/she first
received the foregoing NATA/CATA certification.
Section 10. Second Opinion.
(a) In addition to consulting her Team's physician or other professional
designated by her Team, a player shall have the right to receive a second medical opinion at her
own expense (to the extent it is not covered under their health insurance or by workers'
compensation) regarding the course of treatment for an injury, illness, or other health condition.
(b) Prior to obtaining a second opinion, a player shall notify the Team in
writing of her decision to seek such second opinion, the name of the physician who will be
performing the evaluation (the "Second Opinion Physician"), and the date and location of the
evaluation. Upon receiving such notice and prior to the player's evaluation, the Team will make
available to the Second Opinion Physician relevant medical information regarding the player.
(c) In connection with obtaining a second opinion, a player may not be absent
from the Team for an unreasonable period of time or miss any games without authorization of
the Team.
(d) If the Second Opinion Physician provides the Team with a written
opinion, and the player has otherwise complied with Section 3(c) and subsection (b) above, the
Team will be required to consider the second opinion in connection with diagnosis or treatment.
For clarity, nothing in this Section 10 shall be construed to alter or limit in any way the rights of
any Team or the obligation of any player under this Agreement.
Section 11. Fitness-to-Play.
(a) The parties shall create such Fitness-to-Play Panels as are necessary to
determine, as set forth in this Section 11, whether players with potentially life-threatening
injuries, illnesses or other health conditions are medically able and medically fit to practice and
play basketball in the WNBA. Each Fitness-to-Play panel shall consist of one (1) physician
appointed by the WNBA, one (1) physician appointed by the Players Association, and one (1)
physician appointed by agreement of the first two (2) physicians. Each member of each panel:
(i) shall be board certified and fellowship trained in his/her field of medical expertise; (ii) shall
be a specialist in the subject matter of the applicable Fitness-to-Play Panel; and (iii) shall have at
least eight (8) years of post-fellowship clinical experience. Each panel will operate by majority
vote, including but not limited to its fitness to play determinations. Once appointed, each
physician on a Fitness-to-Play Panel shall be included on such Panel for the duration of this
Agreement, unless either the WNBA or the Players Association has, by October 1 of any year
covered by this Agreement, served written notice to the other party that a physician has been
removed from such Panel. A party may not remove the physician that the other party appointed
to a Fitness-to-Play Panel. In the event that either party removes a physician from a Fitness-to-
Play Panel pursuant to the foregoing, such removal shall be effective immediately, provided that,
unless otherwise agreed to by the parties, a physician will continue to serve on the Fitness-to-
Play panel in respect of any determination on a player's injury, illness, or medical condition that
has been referred to the panel but for which the panel has not yet issued its written determination.
(b) If the WNBA, a Team, or the Players Association has been advised by a
physician that a player is medically unable and/or medically unfit to perform her duties as a
professional basketball player as a result of a potentially life-threatening injury, illness or other
health condition and/or that performing such duties would create a materially elevated risk of
death for the player, then the WNBA, a Team, or the Players Association may refer the player to
a Fitness-to-Play Panel by making such a referral in writing to the player and to the WNBA,
Team, and Players Association, as applicable. Once so referred, the player will not be permitted
to play or practice in the WNBA until she is cleared to do so by the Panel as set forth below.
(c) (i) Upon the referral described in subsection (b) above, the Panel will
be provided with all medical information in the player's medical file that any member of the
Panel deems relevant to the injury, illness or other health condition for which the player was
referred. The Panel will review the player's injury, illness or other health condition (which
review shall include an in-person examination of the player by each member of the Panel unless
such member determines that an examination by him/her would serve no useful purpose). Upon
conclusion of its review, the Panel shall provide a report to the WNBA, the player's Team, and
the Players Association setting forth its determination and the reasons therefor.
The determination to be made by the Panel is whether, in the
panel's reasonable medical judgment and experience, and having considered current medical
knowledge and the best available objective evidence: (x) the player is medically able and
medically fit to perform her duties as a professional basketball player; and (y) performing such
duties would not create a materially elevated risk of death for the player. Where there are
authoritative medical guidelines on fitness for athletic participation and a particular injury,
illness or other health condition (e.g., the American Heart Association/American College of
Cardiology Scientific Statements on Eligibility and Disqualification – Recommendations for
Competitive Athletes with Cardiovascular Abnormalities), the Panel will consider such
guidelines in making its determination.
Subsequent to the player being referred to a Fitness-to Play-Panel,
and prior to the Panel's review of the player's injury, illness or other health condition, the player
(on behalf of herself and her heirs and assigns) shall be required to sign a release and covenant
not to sue agreement in the form agreed upon by the parties; provided that this agreement shall
not apply to any claim of medical malpractice against a Team-affiliated physician or any
physician retained by the WNBA/Players Association for the medical evaluation process.
(d) In the event that the Fitness-to-Play Panel determines that the player is
medically able and medically fit to play professional basketball pursuant to the standard in
subsection (c) above: (i) the player will be required to sign an informed consent and assumption
of risk agreement in the form agreed upon by the parties before she is able to play or practice in
the WNBA; and (ii) upon satisfying the prior clause, shall be deemed at that time medically able
and fit to play basketball in the WNBA and permitted to do so.
(e) If the Fitness-to-Play Panel does not determine that the player is medically
able and medically fit to play professional basketball pursuant to the standard in subsection (c)
above, the WNBA, a Team, or the Players Association may again refer the player to the Fitness-
to-Play Panel beginning on the later of the first day of the Season that begins immediately
following the date on which the Panel issued its report or nine (9) months after such date. The
party making such referral must have been advised in writing by a physician that there have been
materially changed circumstances since the Panel issued its report (e.g., medical advances or a
material change in the player's medical condition) such that the Panel should reconsider its
determination. If a player is referred under this subsection (e), the Fitness-to-Play Panel shall be
comprised of the same members that reviewed and determined the player's initial referral,
provided that the physicians on such panel are available.
(f) Nothing in this Section 11 shall obligate a Team to permit a player to play
or practice for the Team, even if a Fitness-to-Play Panel determines that the player is medically
able to do so. If the Team disagrees with the Fitness-to-Play Panel's conclusion and refuses to
permit the player to play and practice with the Team due to the injury, illness, or other health
condition for which the player was referred to the Fitness-to-Play Panel, then the Team will be
required, within forty (40) days of the Panel's issuance of its report (the "Evaluation Period"), to
either trade the player, agree to amend the player's contract in accordance with Article V,
Section 3 of this Agreement, or waive the player pursuant to Article V, Section 6(b); provided,
however, that the foregoing shall not apply to any player who is in the last year of her Contract
(excluding any option year) at the time that the Panel provides its report to the WNBA, the
player's Team, and the Players Association pursuant to Section 11(c)(i) above. During the
Evaluation Period, the player, shall cooperate with the Team in connection with the Team's
efforts to evaluate the player's injury, illness or other health condition, including by, among
other things, in a prompt and diligent manner supplying all information requested of her,
completing medical forms, and submitting to all examinations, tests and workouts requested of
her by or on behalf of the Team.
(g) If a player referred to a Fitness-to-Play Panel satisfies the waiting period
set forth in Article VII, Section 2(f) of this Agreement at the time of such referral (or any time
thereafter prior to the Panel issuing its report), then the Team may request that such Panel, acting
by majority vote, also serve as the physician described in Article VII, Section 2(f) of this
Agreement, and accordingly provide in the Panel's report a determination for the purposes of
Article VII, Section 2(f) of this Agreement.
(h) The costs associated with the Fitness-to-Play Panels will be borne equally
by the WNBA and the Players Association.
Section 12. Mental Health.
The parties hereto agree on the importance of providing players with robust
mental health resources and will, among other initiatives, instruct the Medical Director to
develop a list of independent mental health providers in each Team market.
Section 13. Wearables.
The parties hereto agree that use of wearables and other in-game technology
provides a unique opportunity to the WNBA with respect to enhanced broadcasts, differentiated
fan experiences, player health and revenue generation and will work together to develop a
comprehensive policy regarding wearables and other in-game technologies, including working
toward a request for proposal for an in-game wearable prior to the start of the 2020 Season (or as
soon thereafter as is practicable).
