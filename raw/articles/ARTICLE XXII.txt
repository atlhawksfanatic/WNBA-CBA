Except for disputes involving the interpretation of, application of, or compliance
with Article VI, Article VII, Article XII, Article XIII, Article XV, and Article XVI, which shall
be resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXIII, any dispute
(hereinafter a "Grievance") involving the interpretation of, application of, or compliance with the
provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of a Standard Player Contract (except as provided in
paragraph 12 of a Player Contract), including a dispute concerning the validity of a Player
Contract, and/or a WNBA or Team Marketing and Promotional Agreement shall be resolved
exclusively in accordance with the procedures contained in this Article.
Section 2. Grievances with Respect to Discipline Imposed for On-Court Conduct.
All Grievances involving the imposition of discipline upon a player with respect
to on-court conduct shall be resolved exclusively as follows:
(a) Exclusive Jurisdiction.
The Commissioner or her designee shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all on-
court conduct. If disciplined for on-court conduct, the player or the Players Association (acting
on her behalf) shall have the right to appeal such discipline only to the Commissioner. The
decision of the Commissioner or her designee shall be final and binding.
(b) Appeal Procedure.
A player who has been disciplined for on-court conduct (or the Players
Association on her behalf) may initiate an appeal from the imposition of such discipline by
delivering a Notice of Appeal by email (with the original promptly sent by mail) or certified or
overnight mail to the WNBA League Office (Attn: Commissioner) within twenty (20) days from
172shall be deemed delivered on the day it is actually received. The Notice of Appeal shall attach a
copy of the written notice received by the player concerning such discipline and briefly set out
why the player believes that the discipline is unwarranted. The delivery of a Notice of Appeal
shall not excuse a player from prompt compliance with such discipline, including the prompt
payment of any fine or serving of a suspension, nor shall it delay, where applicable, the
withholding of Base Salary. If a decision rendered by the Commissioner or her designee directs
the return of any amounts paid by or withheld from the player, such amounts shall be returned to
the player within ten (10) days following such decision.
(c) Hearing.
Following its receipt of the Notice of Appeal, the WNBA League Office shall set
a hearing date and time and communicate such information to the player, the player's Team, and
the Players Association. All hearings will be held at the WNBA's League Office in New York
City or, at the player's option, by telephonic means. Each party shall pay its own travel costs
associated with the hearing (including costs associated with any witnesses it intends to call). The
Hearing Officer shall be the Commissioner or her designee. At the hearing, formal rules of
evidence shall not apply and the Hearing Officer shall have the same discretion as a contract
arbitrator as to which evidence to receive and all rules of procedure. At the conclusion of the
hearing, the Hearing Officer may issue a decision immediately or take the matter under
advisement. In either instance, a written notice of the decision setting forth its rationale shall be
delivered to all parties within ten (10) business days of the hearing. The decision of the Hearing
Officer shall be final and binding.

exclusively as follows:
(a) Player Discipline Grievances.

exceed the threshold amounts set forth in Section 8 below) shall be resolved pursuant to the
arbitration procedures set forth in Section 4, below.
(b) Grievances Not Involving Player Discipline.
Grievances not involving player discipline may be initiated by the
Players Association, a player, a Team, or the WNBA, as the case may be, by delivering a written
Grievance Notice to the opposing party within thirty (30) days of the date of the occurrence or
non-occurrence upon which the Grievance is based, or within thirty (30) days of the date on
which the facts of the matter became known or reasonably should have become known to the
party initiating the Grievance, whichever is later. Such Grievance Notice shall include the date
and a brief description of the issue in dispute. All Grievance Notices may be delivered by email
(with the original promptly sent by mail) or certified or overnight mail; if delivered to the
WNBA League Office, must be addressed to the attention of the Commissioner; and shall be
deemed delivered when they are actually sent.
Within fourteen (14) days following delivery of the Grievance
Notice, the party initiating the Grievance must request in writing a meeting (in person or by
telephone) ("Grievance Meeting") with the party or parties against whom the Grievance was

2021, and as of each successive November 1 hereunder, either of the parties to this Agreement

last Season covered by this Agreement, either of the parties may discharge the Arbitrator by

Agreement. An Arbitrator as to whom a notice of discharge has been served shall continue to
have jurisdiction only with respect to (i) Grievances as to which a hearing has been commenced
or scheduled for a date certain and (ii) Grievances filed within the thirty (30) day period
preceding the service of a notice of discharge; provided, however, that a hearing with respect to
Grievances referred to in this subsection (ii) must commence no later than thirty (30) days

representatives of professional athletes; labor organizations representing athletes; sports leagues,
governing bodies, or their affiliates; sports teams or their affiliates; or owners in any professional
sport. If, within seven (7) days from the receipt of such list, the parties fail to agree upon the
selection of an Arbitrator from among the names on such list, they shall return that list, with up
to five (5) names deleted therefrom by each party, to the CPR Institute (or such other
organization as the parties may have agreed upon), and the CPR Institute (or such other
organization) shall choose a new Arbitrator from the names remaining on such list.
176Upon at least thirty (30) days' written notice to the other side, the
WNBA and the Players Association may arrange to have a hearing scheduled on a date that is
mutually convenient to the parties to the dispute, the WNBA, the Players Association, and the
Arbitrator; provided, however, that if the WNBA and the Players Association cannot agree on a
hearing date, the Arbitrator shall set a reasonable hearing date that follows the expiration of the
30-day notice period. Only the WNBA and the Players Association may schedule hearings
before the Arbitrator.

each Salary Cap Year covered by this Agreement, the Players Association and the WNBA shall
each have the right, upon a showing of need, to have two (2) Grievances scheduled for hearing
on or after the seventh business day following service of the notice provided for by Section
4(c)(i) above (an "Expedited Hearing"); provided that, if either party has exhausted its two (2)
Expedited Hearings for the relevant Salary Cap Year, such party shall be entitled to a third
Expedited Hearing, solely with respect to a dispute (involving one or more players) arising under
Article XIV, Section 9.

the hearing date is thereafter postponed at the request of either the WNBA or the Players
Association, the postponement fee (if any) of the Arbitrator will be borne by the party requesting
the postponement unless that party objects and the Arbitrator finds that the request for such
postponement was for good cause. Should good cause be found, the parties will share any
postponement fee equally.
177Association may request or be granted more than one (1) postponement of a hearing previously
scheduled. If a party which has been granted a postponement of a hearing fails to attend a
subsequently scheduled hearing in the same Grievance matter, the Grievance shall be deemed to
have been decided against that party.
If a hearing of a Grievance has not been scheduled to take place
within one (1) year of the filing of the Grievance, or, in the circumstance where the initial date
set for the hearing has been postponed, if a hearing in that Grievance is not scheduled to take
place within two (2) years from initiation of the filing of the Grievance, then the Grievance shall
be dismissed with prejudice.
For purposes of computing time under this Section 4, the time shall
be tolled during any period when there is no Arbitrator or when the grieving party has been
unable to schedule a hearing (after making reasonable efforts to do so) because the Arbitrator is
unavailable.
(d) Procedure.
Hearings before the Arbitrator shall be held in New York (alternating between the
WNBA and Players Association offices). Hearings shall be conducted in accordance with the
Labor Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association.
(e) Costs.
Subject to Section 4(c)(iii) above, the fees and expenses of the Arbitrator shall be
borne equally by all parties to the arbitration, but all other costs (travel, etc.), including costs
associated with witnesses, shall be paid by the party incurring such costs.

within thirty (30) days following the conclusion of the hearing (or thirty (30) days after the filing
of the last post-hearing brief). The decision and award (if any) of the Arbitrator will constitute
full, final and complete disposition of the Grievance and will be binding upon the player, the
Players Association, the player's Team, and the WNBA.

other limitations as may be imposed on the Arbitrator by this Agreement, the Arbitrator shall

relating to the License Agreement; (vi) award declaratory relief in connection with a proceeding
initiated by the WNBA to determine whether it may properly terminate a Player Contract and
what, if any, liability it would incur as a result of such termination; and (vii) resolve disputes
arising under Article XXI and Exhibit 2 of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing or
any other provision of this Agreement or the Standard Player Contract, the Arbitrator shall not
have jurisdiction or authority to add to, detract from, or alter in any way the provisions of this
Agreement (including the provisions of this subsection), the License Agreement, any Standard
Player Contract, or any WNBA or Team Marketing and Promotional Agreement.
179Services.
In addition to any other rights the WNBA and/or a Team may have under contract
or law, including those under paragraph 12 of a Standard Player Contract, the WNBA and/or a
Team may recover damages in a proceeding before the Arbitrator when a player who is party to a
Player Contract fails or refuses to render the services called for under such Player Contract. In
any such proceeding, where the Arbitrator determines that damages are continuing to accrue at
the time of the hearing, the Arbitrator shall award such damages (if any) as the WNBA and/or a
Team has by then sustained, and the hearing shall remain open to enable the submission of proof
on the issue of continuing damages.
Section 7. Injury Grievances.
(a) If a party to a dispute arising under Article XX, Section 1(c) of this
Agreement so elects, the WNBA and the Players Association shall agree upon a neutral
physician or (in the absence of such agreement) jointly request that the President of the
American College of Orthopedic Surgeons (or such other similar organization as the WNBA and
the Players Association agree may be most appropriate to the issues in dispute) designate a
physician who has no relationship with any party covered by this Agreement who shall, for
purposes of the dispute, serve as an independent medical expert and consultant to the Arbitrator;
it being understood that any such election made in connection with an Expedited Hearing, may
result in a slight delay (as determined by the Arbitrator) to the Expedited Hearing date. Such
independent medical expert shall conduct a physical examination of the player; review such
medical records and reports relating to the player that bear on the issues in dispute; and prepare a
written report of the player's medical condition, which report shall address any specific medical
questions submitted to the independent medical expert by joint agreement of the parties or by the
180provided in writing to the parties in advance of any hearing scheduled pursuant to Section 4(c)
above. The opinions and conclusions of the independent medical expert shall be accorded such
weight as the Arbitrator deems appropriate. The fees and costs of the independent medical
expert shall be borne equally by both sides.
(b) During the course of any arbitration proceeding, the Arbitrator may, by
appropriate process, require any person (including, but not limited to, a Team and a Team
physician, and a player and any physician consulted by such player) to provide to the player or
that player's Team, as the case may be, all medical information in the possession of any such
person relating to the subject matter of the arbitration.

case of player discipline administered by a Team, the player has been fined, or suspended with a
loss of Base Salary of, more than \$300; or (ii) in the case of player discipline administered by the
WNBA, the player has been fined, or suspended with a loss of Base Salary of, more than \$550.

agreement of the WNBA and the Players Association.

such Team.
(c) The parties recognize that a player may be subjected to disciplinary action
for just cause by the WNBA or the player's Team. Therefore, in Grievances regarding
discipline, the issue to be resolved shall be whether there has been just cause for the penalty
imposed.
(d) Nothing contained herein shall excuse the player from prompt compliance
with any discipline imposed upon her. If discipline imposed upon a player is determined to be
improper by a final disposition under this Article XXII, the player shall promptly be made
whole.

the right of the WNBA or any Team to impose discipline upon a player(s) or to take any other
action not inconsistent with the provisions of a Player Contract or this Agreement.
