Section 1. Licensing Rights.
The Players Association, on behalf of present and future WNBA players, agrees
that:
(a) The WNBA and/or WNBA Enterprises have the right to use the Player
Attributes of each WNBA player as such term is defined and for such group licensing purposes
as are set forth in the agreement between WNBA Enterprises and the Players Association, dated
January 17, 2020 (the "Licensing Agreement");
(b) The WNBA and/or WNBA Enterprises have the worldwide right to use or
license in a group of three (3) or more players the Player Attributes of all such players (including
the right to make individual use, or license the individual use, of a player's Player Attributes in a
series of three (3) or more players) solely in combination with the use of any or all WNBA and
Team names, logos, trademarks, trade dress, uniforms or other form of WNBA intellectual
property: (i) in any form of trade or consumer promotion, marketing or advertising; and (ii) in
any advertising, marketing or collateral materials or public service or marketing programs
conducted by the WNBA, WNBA Enterprises, or any Team that, without regard to whether such
use includes sponsor identification, is intended to (y) promote (A) a Team, the WNBA, players,
the sponsor, the sport of basketball and/or women's empowerment, (B) any game or competition
in which a Team or group of players participates, or (C) any telecast or broadcast of such a game
or competition and/or (z) further the development, popularity or growth of the WNBA and/or the
sport of basketball (e.g., in connection with basketball clinics, "grass roots" programs and similar
non-commercial activities) (the materials and programs described in clause (ii) above
collectively referred to as "League Materials and Programs"); and
(c) In order to both attract new sponsor investment in the WNBA and elevate
player brands and increase future player endorsement opportunities by associating players with
marquee marketing partners, the WNBA and/or WNBA Enterprises will have the worldwide
right to use or license the Player Attributes of individual players solely in combination with the
use of any or all WNBA and Team names, logos, trademarks, trade dress, uniforms or other form
of WNBA intellectual property: (i) in any form of trade or consumer promotion, marketing or
advertising; and (ii) in any advertising, marketing or collateral materials or public service or
marketing programs conducted by the WNBA, WNBA Enterprises, or any Team that, without
regard to whether such use includes sponsor identification, is intended to (y) promote (A) a
Team, the WNBA, players, the sponsor, the sport of basketball and/or women's empowerment,
(B) any game or competition in which a Team or group of players participates, or (C) any
telecast or broadcast of such a game or competition and/or (z) further the development,
popularity or growth of the WNBA and/or the sport of basketball (e.g., in connection with
basketball clinics, "grass roots" programs and similar non-commercial activities). With respect
to any individual use of players in sponsor marketing or advertising pursuant to this subsection
(c) only: (i) the player will be provided with at least seven (7) days' advance written notice of
such usage (with a copy to the Players Association) and may opt out of such usage in writing
within three (3) days of receipt of such notice; (ii) such usage will not be in the footwear, apparel
or sports drink category; (iii) such usage will not be in a sponsor or product category in which
the player has a Bona Fide Exclusive Endorsement Agreement with a conflicting sponsor during
the term of such Bona Fide Exclusive Endorsement Agreement; and (iv) such usage will be used
or licensed on a year-to-year basis (i.e., will only be extended beyond one year if the player
continues not to have a competing Bona Fide Exclusive Endorsement Agreement). In making
individual usage of players pursuant to this subsection (c), the WNBA and/or WNBA Enterprises
shall take into consideration the diversity of the player population and shall use commercially
reasonable efforts to coordinate with the Players Association's preferred social media partner
when such usage involves sponsor-related social media posts.
Section 2. Player Marketing Rights.
(a) A player will not license her Player Attributes: (i) for use during any
Season to any entity (other than a WNBA Sponsor) that competes in a Designated Sponsor
Category, or (ii) for use in connection with any product or service pursuant to an agreement that
would preclude or interfere with the full and complete exercise by WNBA Enterprises or the
WNBA (or any of its Teams) of the rights granted in this Article XXVI, or paragraph 6 of the
Standard Player Contract or the Licensing Agreement.
(b) WNBA Enterprises shall provide the Players Association with a list of up
to four (4) Designated Sponsor Categories on or before the March 15 prior to each Season and
shall promptly notify the Players Association of additions, deletions and modifications to such
lists.
(c) Any sponsorship, endorsement or licensing agreement (including any
agreement with regard to footwear) entered into by a player during the term of her Standard
Player Contract must expressly provide that any provisions of such agreement that conflict or are
inconsistent with any provisions of either this Agreement or the player's Standard Player
Contract shall be of no force or effect.
 (d) No player may (i) permit any entity (other than a WNBA licensee) to
manufacture a product bearing any of her Player Attributes or (ii) appear in any form of trade or
consumer promotion or advertising on behalf of any entity (other than a WNBA Sponsor or a
WNBA licensee identified in the Licensing Agreement), if such product, premium, promotion, or
advertising (as the case may be): (x) creates an association between the WNBA (or any of its
Teams) and the manufacturer of such product or premium or the entity for which the player is
appearing in the promotion or advertising (e.g., through the use or reference to any form of
WNBA intellectual property (including Team colors) or any WNBA arena, WNBA practice
facility or WNBA basketball); or (y) violates any provision of this Agreement or the player's
Standard Player Contract.
(e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this Article XXVI
(including Section 2(a) above), a player shall have the right to have the identification of a
WNBA Sponsor removed from advertising, premiums, and point-of-sale displays that contain
her Player Attributes on an individual basis as part of a series if she has a Bona Fide Exclusive
Endorsement Agreement with a conflicting sponsor that expressly prohibits the player's likeness
from being used in connection with such activities by companies (other than the conflicting
sponsor) engaged in the type of business for which the player is obligated to perform
endorsement services under such Bona Fide Exclusive Endorsement Agreement. The right of the
player contained in the preceding sentence shall exist only during the term of such Bona Fide
Exclusive Endorsement Agreement.
(f) The rights granted to the WNBA and WNBA Enterprises and the
obligations undertaken by the players and Players Association under Section 1 above do not
include, and should not be construed to include, any right to use Player Attributes in a manner
that creates an endorsement or testimonial for any product or service by any player or group of
players. WNBA Enterprises shall not license any WNBA Sponsor to use individually a player's
Player Attributes in a series pursuant to Section 1(b)(i) above in a manner that features,
highlights or individually promotes such Player to a greater degree relative to the other players in
the series. WNBA Enterprises shall use reasonable efforts to cause any license agreement
providing a WNBA Sponsor with rights to use individually a player's Player Attributes in a
series pursuant to Section 1(b)(i) to use at least five (5) Players in such series.
(g) The Players Association acknowledges that WNBA Enterprises or the
WNBA may enter into corporate sponsorship agreements with respect to League awards and
achievements ("Awards") and (i) that any player named a recipient of any such Award shall be
required to accept such Award notwithstanding the terms of any Bona Fide Exclusive
Endorsement Agreement or conflict between a Player's Bona Fide Licensee and the Award
sponsor, (ii) that such Award sponsor shall be entitled to reasonably announce the fact that the
player won the Award in the promotion of its Award sponsorship (e.g., in a congratulatory
advertisement), and (iii) that, in connection with such announcement and promotion, the Award
sponsor shall be entitled to make reasonable use of the player's Player Attributes and the Player
Attributes of any other players nominated for such Award. WNBA Enterprises shall not,
pursuant to the rights granted to it pursuant to Section 1(b) above, authorize any sponsor in such
a corporate sponsorship agreement to use a player's Player Attributes in a manner that would
constitute an endorsement or testimonial for any product or service by such player.
Section 3. Commercial Appearances.
(a) A Player may, during each Season and the immediately succeeding Off-
Season covered by a Standard Player Contract to which she is a party, be required to make up to
six (6) commercial appearances on behalf of WNBA Sponsors or licensees, at the request of the
WNBA or its designees upon at least seven (7) days' prior notice in each instance. Such
commercial appearances, unless otherwise agreed to by the player, shall (i) occur between April
1 and the last day of the immediately succeeding Off-Season, and (ii) not conflict with the
contractual obligations of the Player under any then-current Bona Fide Exclusive Endorsement
Agreement of the Player, and (iii) be subject to the appearances guidelines set forth in Section
1(d) of Article XXIV of this Agreement. Any such appearances not scheduled to take place
during the Season shall be scheduled at times and locations agreeable to the player and the
WNBA or its designee. The Player shall be paid \$750 for each appearance that she makes
pursuant to this Section 3(a). Players will also be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses actually
incurred in connection with appearances required pursuant to this Section 3(a), provided such
expenses are documented to the WNBA, result directly from the appearance and are ordinary and
reasonable.
(b) In addition to the commercial appearances called for by Section 3(a)
above, a player may, during each Season and the immediately succeeding Off-Season covered by
a Standard Player Contract to which she is a party, be required to make up to three (3)
appearances on behalf of sponsors designated by her Team, upon at least seven (7) days' prior
notice in each instance. Such appearances shall be subject to the appearances guidelines set forth
in Section 1(d) of Article XXIV of this Agreement. The Player shall receive no payment for
such Team sponsor appearances; provided, however, that the player will be reimbursed for out-
of-pocket expenses actually incurred in connection with such required appearances, provided
such expenses are documented to the Team, result directly from the appearance and are ordinary
and reasonable. Any such appearances during the Off-Season will be scheduled at times and
locations agreeable to the Player and the Team. The player may be paid by the Team for each
commercial appearance she makes during a Season and succeeding Off-Season in excess of the
three (3) appearances described above, provided that a player shall not receive more than \$750
for any such appearance and no Team may pay a player a total of more than \$3,000 for all
commercial appearances performed by the player during any Season and immediately
succeeding Off-Season under this Section 3(b) meaning that no player may be required to make
more than seven (7) commercial appearances during any Season and immediately succeeding
Off-Season pursuant to this Article XXVI (it being understood that the \$3,000 limitation set forth
above shall not apply to commercial appearances performed by the player pursuant to a Team
Marketing and Promotional Agreement).
Section 4. Players Association Marketing.
The Players Association agrees that it will not engage in or conduct (or permit or
license any third party to engage in or conduct) any form of trade or consumer promotion,
marketing or advertising that uses or refers to WNBA intellectual property (including Team
colors), to any WNBA arena, WNBA practice facility or WNBA basketball or that otherwise
creates an association between the WNBA (or any of its Teams) and a third party.
Section 5. Pictures.
The Players Association, on behalf of present and future WNBA players, agrees
that (i) the WNBA, WNBA Enterprises, and the Team shall have the right to take or create (or
have taken or created) Pictures or likenesses of players at any WNBA Competition or WNBA or
Team sponsored event; and (ii) players shall be available to have their Picture taken or likeness
created, individually or with other players in the WNBA, at such times and places as WNBA or
the Team shall reasonably designate. All rights in such Pictures or likenesses shall belong
exclusively to the WNBA. The WNBA shall have the worldwide exclusive right to use,
distribute or license any such Pictures (or excerpts or portions thereof) or likenesses in League
Materials and Programs.
Section 6. Apparel.
A player shall wear all apparel, and only such apparel, supplied by her Team or
the WNBA for all WNBA Competitions, practices and press conferences, and shall not alter the
appearance of such apparel or cover (in whole or in part) any name, logo, symbol or emblem on
such apparel. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, a player may wear manufacturer logo-
identified shoes during WNBA Competitions, practices and press conferences as long as such
manufacturer has been designated by WNBA Enterprises as an authorized WNBA footwear
supplier and the player has a Qualifying Shoe Deal with such manufacturer. If the player has a
Qualifying Shoe Deal with a manufacturer that is not an authorized footwear supplier, then the
player may wear such manufacturer's shoes during WNBA Competitions, practices and press
conferences but without any visible manufacturer logo or other manufacturer identification. If
the player does not have a Qualifying Shoe Deal, then the player shall wear during WNBA
Competitions, practices and press conferences the shoes supplied by a supplier designated by the
WNBA. If the player does not have a Qualifying Shoe Deal and advises the WNBA that the
shoes supplied by the WNBA designated supplier do not fit her properly, the WNBA shall in
good faith request that the manufacturer of such shoes provide a better fitting pair of shoes.
Section 7. Player Content Creation.
Players shall be required to comply with reasonable content creation and social
media distribution requests (e.g., by using their social media accounts to provide behind-the-
scenes access to, and images of, WNBA events) of the WNBA or their Teams that are designed,
among other things, to market the League, the Team, the player, the sport of basketball and
women's empowerment, and to generate WNBA and Team revenue (e.g., as part of a sponsor
pitch deck).
Section 8. Co-Branded Events.
The parties hereto agree to discuss the creation of a limited number of WNBA and
Players Association co-branded and, where appropriate, co-funded initiatives.
