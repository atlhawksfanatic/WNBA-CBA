REVENUE SHARING
Section 1. Revenue Sharing Agreement.
(a) If, for any Season during the term of this Agreement (for purposes of this
Article XII, the "Current Season") beginning with the 2021 Season, "Cumulative League
Revenue" exceeds the "Cumulative Revenue Target" applicable to such Season, then, subject to
the provisions of this Article XII, the players will be paid an amount equal to fifty percent (50%)
of Shared Revenue (as defined below) as follows:
The WNBA shall be obligated to pay an amount equal to twenty-
five percent (25%) of Shared Revenue to all WNBA players who were on a WNBA roster during
the applicable Regular Season. Such payment shall be effectuated and satisfied solely by the
WNBA paying such amount to Teams no later than sixty (60) days following the submission of
the League Revenue Report (as defined below) to the Players Association and causing the Teams
to distribute as soon as practicable such amount on such proportional basis as may be reasonably
determined by the Players Association, less all amounts required to be withheld by any
governmental authority. The Players Association shall provide the WNBA with its proposed
per-player distribution of any such amount within thirty (30) days after the WNBA's submission
of the League Revenue Report to it.
The minimum amount required to be spent on WNBA Marketing
and Promotional Agreements in the Marketing Period immediately following the Season after the
Current Season shall be increased by twenty-five percent (25%) of Shared Revenue.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the League Revenue Reports are subject to any dispute before
the Arbitrator pursuant to Section 2(c)(v) below, which is not resolved within ninety (90) days
following the submission of the League Revenue Report to the Players Association, any
106be increased in the Marketing Period immediately following the Season in which such dispute is
resolved, or if such dispute is resolved in an Off-Season, the following Marketing Period.
(b) For purposes of this Article XII:
"League Revenue" for a Season will equal the total revenue
amount, calculated based on U.S. generally accepted accounting principles, recorded in the
WNBA, LLC and Subsidiaries Consolidated Statements of Income, less any portion of such total
revenue amount that is attributable to (i) barter transactions; and (ii) expansion or the transfer or
relocation of a Team.
"Cumulative League Revenue" is the sum of League Revenue
from the 2020 Season through the Current Season.
The "Cumulative Revenue Target" for a Season will be calculated,
commencing with the 2021 Season, as follows:
Step 1: Apply an annual compound twenty percent (20%)
increase to 2019 League Revenue through the Current Season.
Step 2: Sum amounts calculated in Step 1 above from 2020
through the Current Season to determine the Current Season's Cumulative Revenue Target. For
example, if 2019 League Revenue were ten million dollars (\$10,000,000), the 2022 Cumulative
Revenue Target would be forty-three million, six hundred and eighty thousand dollars
(\$43,680,000) (\$12,000,000 plus \$14,400,000 plus \$17,280,000).
The "Cumulative Overage" for any Season is the amount by which
Cumulative League Revenue exceeds the Cumulative Revenue Target.
107from the Season immediately prior to the Current Season.
The "Net Overage" for any Season is the Cumulative Overage less
the greater of the Prior Overage and zero. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Article
XII, if the Net Overage is a negative number for any Season, there shall be no revenue sharing
for such Season.
"Shared Revenue" for any Season is the Net Overage less a thirty
percent (30%) deemed cost of revenue (i.e., the Net Overage multiplied by 0.7).
Section 2. Accounting Procedures.
(a) Within thirty (30) days of the execution of this Agreement, with respect to
the 2019 Season, and within one hundred and twenty (120) days following the 2020 Season and
each Season thereafter covered by this Agreement, the WNBA shall submit a report to the
Players Association setting forth League Revenue for such Season (the "League Revenue
Report"). The League Revenue Report will be prepared based upon the audited amounts
included in the WNBA, LLC and Subsidiaries Consolidated Financial Statements for the
respective fiscal year.
(b) (i) After the submission of each League Revenue Report, the Players
Association shall have the right, with respect to any Season hereunder (including the 2019
Season), to have its own representatives conduct, or to retain its own accountants (the "Players
Association's Accountants"), at its own expense, to conduct, an audit of the books and records of
the WNBA, provided, however, that such audit shall be limited to revenue.
The Players Association may exercise the right set forth in Section
2(b)(i) above by providing written notice (stating its intention to request such annual review) that
108Association of the League Revenue Report. If such written notice is not received by the WNBA
within such thirty (30)-day period, then League Revenue for the applicable Season shall be the
amount set forth in the League Revenue Report.
(c) If the Players Association elects to perform a review in accordance with
Section 2(b) above:
The Players Association will sign, and cause its representatives to
sign, a confidentiality agreement in a form reasonably prescribed by the WNBA.
For purposes of validating League Revenue, the Players
Association Accountants shall perform such review procedures during normal business hours
over a period of five (5) days.
The Players Association shall notify designated representatives of
the WNBA of any proposed adjustments to any item contained in the League Revenue Reports
by March 15 of the calendar year following the conclusion of the Current Season and each party
will resolve any proposed adjustment by April 30 of the same calendar year.
If the Players Association exercises its right set forth in Section
2(b) above, any payments pursuant to Section 1(a)(i) above will be due thirty (30) days following
the completion of any adjustments to the League Revenue Report pursuant to the procedures
contained in this Section 2 (whether pursuant to subsection (iii) above or following the
conclusion of any dispute resolved by the Arbitrator pursuant to subsection (v) below).
All disputes with respect to any review of a League Revenue
Report shall be resolved exclusively in accordance with the procedures set forth in Article XXIII.
