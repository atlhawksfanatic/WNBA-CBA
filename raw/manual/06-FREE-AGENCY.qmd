remain open through the following March 7; provided, however, that the Restricted Qualifying
Offer may be withdrawn by the Team during the period February 16 through March 7 but only if
the player agrees in writing to the withdrawal. If a Restricted Qualifying Offer is withdrawn, the
player shall immediately become an Unrestricted Free Agent. A player who knows or
reasonably should have known that she has a physical disability or other condition (including
pregnancy) that would render her physically unable to perform the playing services required
under a Player Contract the following Season may not validly accept a Restricted Qualifying
Offer made under this Section 5 or Section 6 below, unless the ROFR Team consents after
disclosure of such physical disability or condition (provided that the Team may, at its election,
and prior to determining whether to consent, conduct a physical examination of the player). In
the event that the ROFR Team does not consent, such player will remain subject to the ROFR
Team's Right of First Refusal. In no event may a player accept a Restricted Qualifying Offer
beyond the March 7 following its issuance. If a Restricted Qualifying Offer is neither withdrawn
nor accepted and the deadline for accepting it passes, the Team's Right of First Refusal shall

meet one or more of the criteria for a Restricted Qualifying Offer shall be made by notice to the
54given by the Team or the WNBA to the Players Association. Such notice must set forth the
specific changes that allegedly must be made to the offered Contract in order for it to constitute a
Restricted Qualifying Offer. Upon receipt of such notice, if the requested changes are necessary
to satisfy the requirements of a Restricted Qualifying Offer, the Team may, within five (5)
business days, offer the player an amended Contract incorporating the requested changes. If the
Team offers such an amended Contract, the player and the Players Association shall be
precluded from asserting that such Contract does not constitute a timely and valid Restricted
Qualifying Offer.
Section 6. Restricted Free Agency.
(a) If a Restricted Free Agent does not sign an Offer Sheet (as defined below)
with any Team by the July 1 of the WNBA Season for which the Restricted Qualifying Offer is
made, and does not sign a Player Contract with the ROFR Team before that Season ends, then
her ROFR Team may reassert its Right of First Refusal for the following WNBA Season by
extending another Restricted Qualifying Offer (with the same terms, including the amount of
Salary that was included in the prior Restricted Qualifying Offer, subject to the Minimum Player
Salary) by the next January 14. A ROFR Team may continue to reassert its Right of First
Refusal by following the foregoing procedure in each subsequent year in which that Restricted
Free Agent does not sign an Offer Sheet with any Team by the July 1 of the WNBA Season for
which the Restricted Qualifying Offer is made, and does not sign a Player Contract with the
ROFR Team before that Season ends. Any such Restricted Qualifying Offer shall be governed
by the provisions of Section 5 above.
55from a Team (the "New Team") other than the ROFR Team, which she desires to accept, she
shall give to the ROFR Team a completed certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit 6
annexed hereto (the "Offer Sheet"), signed by the Restricted Free Agent and the New Team,
which shall have attached to it a Standard Player Contract separately specifying the "Principal
Terms" (as defined in Section 6(c) below) of the New Team's offer. The Offer Sheet must be for
a Player Contract with a term of more than one WNBA season. In order to extend an Offer
Sheet, the New Team must have Room for the player's Player Contract at the time the Offer
Sheet is signed and must continue to have such Room at all times while the Offer Sheet is
outstanding. The ROFR Team, upon receipt of the Offer Sheet, may exercise its Right of First
Refusal, which shall have the consequences hereinafter set forth below in this Section 6. In order
to match an Offer Sheet, the ROFR Team must have Room for the player's Player Contract at the
time the notice of its Right of First Refusal is given and must continue to have Room at all times
the First Refusal Exercise Notice remains in effect.
(c) The Principal Terms of an Offer Sheet are only:
The fixed and specified Base Salary that the New Team will pay to
the Restricted Free Agent on the dates specified in the Standard Player Contract;
Term;
Base Salary protection provided for each Season as set forth in
Exhibit 2 (if any);
Prior-injury exclusion terms set forth in Exhibit 3 (if any).
An Offer Sheet may not contain a Time Off Bonus.
56Team gives to the Restricted Free Agent a "First Refusal Exercise Notice" substantially in the
form of Exhibit 7 annexed hereto, such Restricted Free Agent and the ROFR Team shall be
deemed to have entered into a Player Contract, effective as of the date the First Refusal Exercise
Notice is given, containing all the Principal Terms included in the Standard Player Contract
attached to the Offer Sheet and no additional terms.
(e) If the ROFR Team does not give the First Refusal Exercise Notice within
the aforementioned four (4) day period, or if during such four (4) day period the ROFR Team
provides written notice to the player that the Team declines to exercise its Right of First Refusal,
then the player and the New Team shall be deemed to have entered into a Player Contract
containing all of the terms and conditions included in the Standard Player Contract attached to
the Offer Sheet and no additional terms.
(f) After exercising its Right of First Refusal as described in this Section 6,
the ROFR Team may not trade the Restricted Free Agent until the following February 1, without
the player's consent. Even with the player's consent, until such following February 1, neither the
ROFR Team exercising its Right of First Refusal nor any other Team may trade the player to the
Team whose Offer Sheet was matched.
(g) Any Team that exercises its Right of First Refusal may do so subject to the
player's passing a physical examination to be conducted by the Team within five (5) days from
its exercise of the Right of First Refusal. In the event the player does not pass the physical
examination, the ROFR Team may withdraw its First Refusal Exercise notice within five (5)
days following the date upon which such examination is conducted; however, the New Team
may not withdraw the previously submitted Offer Sheet. In the event the player, after being
57(5) days of the exercise of the Right of First Refusal then, until such time as the player submits to
the requested physical examination, the ROFR Team may withdraw its First Refusal Exercise
Notice, which shall have the effect of invalidating the Offer Sheet and causing the Team that
issued the Offer Sheet to be prohibited from signing or acquiring the player for a period of one
(1) year from the date the First Refusal Exercise Notice was withdrawn. In lieu of exercising its
Right of First Refusal subject to the player's passing of a physical examination as provided for
above, the ROFR Team may conduct a physical examination of the player prior to deciding
whether to exercise its Right of First Refusal, provided that the player consents in writing to such
physical examination.
(h) There may be only one Offer Sheet signed by a Restricted Free Agent
outstanding at any one time, provided that the Offer Sheet has also been signed by a Team. An
Offer Sheet, both before and after it is given to the ROFR Team, may be revoked or withdrawn
only upon the written consent of the ROFR Team, the New Team, and the Restricted Free Agent.
In such event, a Restricted Free Agent shall again be free to negotiate and sign an Offer Sheet
with any Team, and any Team shall again be free to negotiate and sign an Offer Sheet with such
Restricted Free Agent, subject only to the ROFR Team's renewed Right of First Refusal.
(i) If a dispute arises between the player and either the ROFR Team or the
New Team, as the case may be, relating to the contents of an Offer Sheet, and/or whether the
binding agreement is between the Restricted Free Agent and the New Team or the Restricted
Free Agent and the ROFR Team, such dispute shall immediately be submitted to the Arbitrator,
who shall resolve such dispute within five (5) days.
58at any time after the July 1 of the Season for which she has been made a Qualifying Offer.
(k) On the same day as the giving of an Offer Sheet to the ROFR Team, the
ROFR Team shall cause a copy thereof to be given to the WNBA, which shall cause a copy
thereof to be promptly given to the Players Association. On the same day as the giving of a First
Refusal Exercise Notice to the Restricted Free Agent, the Restricted Free Agent shall cause the
copy thereof to be given to the New Team, which shall cause a copy thereof to be promptly
given to the WNBA, which shall cause a copy thereof to be promptly given to the Players
Association.
(l) There may be no consideration of any kind given by one Team to another
Team in exchange for a Team's decision to exercise or not to exercise its Right of First Refusal,
or in exchange for a Team's decision to submit or not to submit an Offer Sheet to a Restricted
Free Agent.

Section 7. Core Players.
(a) Each Team shall be permitted to designate no more than one (1) of its
Veteran Free Agents as Core Players. Such a designation can apply to any Veteran Free Agent
who would otherwise be an Unrestricted Free Agent or a Restricted Free Agent. Any Veteran
Free Agent who has previously been designated as a Core Player by a Team and remains under
Contract to play for such Team during the upcoming Season pursuant to a Player Contract signed
while such player was so designated (but not including Seasons covered by any Extension to
such Contract) shall be included in the maximum number of players who may be designated as a
Core Player by such Team.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, no player may be
designated as a Core Player during the period when Core Player Designations may be given prior
to the 2020 Season and 2021 Season if such player has played pursuant to a Contract signed
while such player was designated as a Core Player (a "Core Player Contract") for three (3) or
more Seasons and no player may be designated as a Core Player during the period when Core
Player Designations may be given prior to the 2022 Season and each Season thereafter during the
term of this Agreement if such player has played pursuant to a Core Player Contract for two (2)
or more Seasons. Players who have played pursuant to Core Player Contracts prior to the 2020
62Nothing in this Section 7 is intended to limit the maximum allowable term of a Contract between
a Team and a player designated as a Core Player by such Team as provided for in Article V,
Section 12.
(c) In order to designate a player as a Core Player, the Team must, from the
January 1 following the last Season covered by the player's Player Contract through the
immediately following January 14, provide to the player a Core Player Designation Notice
substantially in the form of Exhibit 8 annexed hereto. Such Core Player Designation Notice,
which shall be personally delivered to the player or her representative, or shall be sent by email
or prepaid certified, registered, or overnight mail to the last known address of the player or her
representative with a copy to the Players Association and the WNBA, shall be signed by the
Team and shall be accompanied by a Core Qualifying Offer. Any Team that designates a Core
Player shall be the only Team with which such Core Player can negotiate or sign a Player
Contract. Such Core Player Designation shall continue to apply until it terminates pursuant to
Section 7(d) below.

Designation will terminate and become available to the Team again upon the earliest of: (i) the
expiration of the original term of such Contract (whether or not such Contract has been extended
by mutual agreement of the parties); (ii) termination of such Contract; (iii) the assignment of
such Contract to another Team; (iv) the retirement of the Core Player; or (v) the suspension of
the Core Player pursuant to Article XIV, Section 2. If the Core Player and Team have not
entered into a Contract, the Core Player Designation will terminate and become available to the
Team again upon the earliest of: (a) the withdrawal by the Team of the Core Qualifying Offer;
63below); (c) the retirement of the Core Player; or (d) November 30 of the Salary Cap Year in
which the Core Player Designation was made by the Team.
(e) In order to designate a player as a Core Player, a Team must have Room
for the Core Qualifying Offer. A Core Qualifying Offer may be withdrawn by the Team at any
time through the following February 15. If the Core Qualifying Offer is not withdrawn by
February 15, it must thereafter remain open through the following March 7; provided, however,
that the Core Qualifying Offer may be withdrawn by the Team during the period February 16
through March 7 if the player agrees in writing to the withdrawal. If a Core Qualifying Offer is
withdrawn, the player shall thereupon immediately become an Unrestricted Free Agent;
provided, however, that if (i) prior to the designation of the player as a Core Player and the
subsequent withdrawal of the Core Qualifying Offer, the player's Prior Team could have
obtained a Right of First Refusal with respect to the player by making her a Restricted
Qualifying Offer, (ii) the Prior Team, following the withdrawal of the Core Qualifying Offer,
makes a Restricted Qualifying Offer to the player in order to obtain a Right of First Refusal, and
(iii) such Restricted Qualifying Offer is made by January 14 of any Salary Cap Year (or if the
withdrawal of the Core Qualifying Offer occurs after January 12, within forty-eight (48) hours of
such withdrawal), then the player shall become a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of
First Refusal in favor of the Team. If a Core Qualifying Offer is neither withdrawn nor accepted

physical disability or other condition (including pregnancy) that would render her physically
64may not validly accept a Core Qualifying Offer made under this Section 7 unless the Team
consents in writing after receiving written notice of such physical disability or other condition.
If, after receiving written notice of such disability or condition (and, if desired by the Team, a
physical examination of the player to confirm such disability or condition), the Team desires to
withdraw the Core Player Designation Notice and the accompanying Core Qualifying Offer, it
shall do so by giving written notice of such withdrawal to the player, and the player shall
thereupon immediately become an Unrestricted Free Agent; provided, however, that if (i) prior
to the designation of the player as a Core Player and the subsequent withdrawal of the Core
Player Designation Notice and accompanying Core Qualifying Offer the Team could have
obtained a Right of First Refusal with respect to such player by making her a Restricted
Qualifying Offer, (ii) the Team, following the withdrawal of the Core Player Designation Notice
and accompanying Core Qualifying Offer, makes a Restricted Qualifying Offer to the player in
order to obtain a Right of First Refusal, and (iii) such Restricted Qualifying Offer is made by
January 14 of any Salary Cap Year (or, if the withdrawal of the Core Player Designation Notice
and accompanying Core Qualifying Offer occurs after January 12, within forty-eight (48) hours
of such withdrawal), then the player shall become a Restricted Free Agent, subject to a Right of
First Refusal in favor of the Team.
(g) At any time after the expiration date (i.e., March 7) of a Core Qualifying
Offer as provided for in subsection (e) above, a Team may renounce a Core Player Designation,
which shall result in its termination as set forth in subsection (d) above. In order to renounce a
Core Player Designation, a Team shall provide the WNBA with an express, written statement
65a copy of such statement within one (1) business day following its receipt thereof.
(h) On the same day as the giving of a Core Player Designation Notice and a
Core Qualifying Offer to a player, the Team shall cause a copy thereof to be given to the WNBA,
which shall cause a copy thereof to be promptly given to the Players Association.
(i) Any claim that a Core Player Designation Notice or the accompanying
Core Qualifying Offer fails to meet one or more of the criteria for a Core Player Designation
Notice or a Core Qualifying Offer shall be made by written notice to the Team no later than ten
(10) days after copies of the Core Player Designation Notice and Core Qualifying Offer are
given by the Team or the WNBA to the Players Association. Such notice must set forth the
specific changes that allegedly must be made to the Core Player Designation Notice or the
offered Contract in order for it to constitute a Core Player Designation Notice and a Core
Qualifying Offer. Upon receipt of such notice, if the requested changes are necessary to satisfy
the requirements of a Core Player Designation Notice and a Core Qualifying Offer, the Team
may, within five (5) business days, deliver or send to the player an amended Core Player
Designation Notice and Core Qualifying Offer incorporating the requested changes. If the Team
offers such an amended Core Player Designation Notice and Core Qualifying Offer, the player
and the Players Association shall be precluded from asserting that such Core Player Designation
Notice and Core Qualifying Offer do not constitute a timely and valid Core Player Designation
Notice and Core Qualifying Offer.
(j) A Core Player Designation Notice and Core Qualifying Offer shall be
deemed given when sent by the Prior Team. Except as provided in Section 6(n) with respect to
First Refusal Exercise Notices and Restricted Qualifying Offers, other writings required or
66addressed.
Section 8. Reserved Players.
(a) Any Veteran Free Agent who has three (3) or fewer Years of Service on
the first day of any Salary Cap Year will be a Reserved Player if her Prior Team makes a
Reserved Qualifying Offer to the player at any time from the January 1 following such Season
through the immediately following January 14. If such Reserved Qualifying Offer is made, then,
on the February 1 following the last Season covered by the player's Player Contract, the player
shall become a Reserved Player, subject to the exclusive negotiating rights of her Prior Team. If
such a Reserved Qualifying Offer is not made, then the player shall become an Unrestricted Free
Agent on such February 1.
(b) In order to make a Reserved Qualifying Offer, a Team must have Room
for the Reserved Qualifying Offer. A Reserved Qualifying Offer made to a Reserved Player may
be withdrawn by the Team at any time through the following February 15. If the Reserved
Qualifying Offer is not withdrawn by February 15, it must thereafter remain open until the
following March 7; provided, however, that the Reserved Qualifying Offer may be withdrawn by
the Team during the period February 16 through March 7 if the player agrees in writing to the
withdrawal. If a Reserved Qualifying Offer is withdrawn, the player shall immediately become
an Unrestricted Free Agent. A player who knows or reasonably should have known that she has
a physical disability or other condition (including pregnancy) that would render her physically
unable to perform the playing services required under a Player Contract the following Season
may not validly accept a Reserved Qualifying Offer made under this Section 8, unless the Prior
Team consents after disclosure of such physical disability or other condition (provided that the
67examination of such player). In the event that the Prior Team does not consent, such player will
remain subject to the Prior Team's exclusive negotiating rights. If a Reserved Qualifying Offer
is neither withdrawn nor accepted and the deadline for accepting it passes, the Team's exclusive
negotiating rights shall continue, subject to Section 8(c) below.
(c) If a Reserved Player does not sign a Player Contract with her Prior Team
by the conclusion of the WNBA Season for which the Reserved Qualifying Offer is made, then
her Prior Team may reassert its exclusive negotiating rights for the following WNBA season by
extending another Reserved Qualifying Offer (on the same terms as the prior Reserved
Qualifying Offer) by the next January 14. A Prior Team may continue to reassert its exclusive
negotiating rights by following the foregoing procedure in each subsequent year in which the
Reserved Player does not sign a Player Contract with her Prior Team before the Season ends.
(d) Any claim that a Contract offered as a Reserved Qualifying Offer fails to
meet one or more of the criteria for a Reserved Qualifying Offer shall be made by notice to the
Team, in writing, no later than ten (10) days after a copy of the Reserved Qualifying Offer was
given by the Team or the WNBA to the Players Association. Such notice must set forth the
specific change that allegedly must be made to the offered Contract in order for it to constitute a
Reserved Qualifying Offer. Upon receipt of such notice, if the requested changes are necessary
to satisfy the requirements of a Reserved Qualifying Offer, the Team may, within five (5)
business days, offer the player an amended Contract incorporating the requested changes. If the
Team offers such an amended Contract, the player and the Players Association shall be
precluded from asserting that such Contract does not constitute a timely and valid Reserved
Qualifying Offer.
