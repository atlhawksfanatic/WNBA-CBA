PLAYER AGENTS
Section 1. Negotiation of Player Contracts.
A Team shall not enter into any Standard Player Contract or Team Marketing and
Promotional Agreement, and the WNBA shall not enter into a WNBA Marketing and
Promotional Agreement, with a player unless such player: (i) is represented in the negotiations
with respect to such Standard Player Contract and/or Marketing and Promotional Agreement by
an agent or representative authorized to represent her and duly certified by the Players
Association in accordance with the Players Association's Agent Regulation Program; or (ii) acts
on her own behalf in negotiating such Standard Player Contract and/or Marketing and
Promotional Agreement.
Section 2. Indemnity.
The Players Association agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the WNBA, its
Teams and each of its and their respective past, present and future affiliates, agents, employees,
successors, designees, assigns, licensees, owners (direct and indirect), officers, directors,
trustees, attorneys, general or limited partners, members, heirs, executors, administrators and
representatives, from any and all claims of any kind arising from or relating to (i) the Players
Association's Agent Regulation Program, and (ii) the provisions of this Article, including,
without limitation, any judgments, costs and settlements, provided that the Players Association is
immediately notified of any such claim in writing (and, in no event later than five (5) days from
the receipt thereof), is given the opportunity to assume the defense thereof, and the WNBA uses
its best efforts to defend such claim, and does not admit liability with respect to and does not
settle such claim without the prior written consent of the Players Association.
208The Players Association agrees to provide the WNBA League Office with a list
of: (i) all agents certified under the Players Association's Agent Regulation Program, and (ii) the
players represented by each such agent. Such list shall be updated once a month from the day
after the WNBA Championship Series to the first day of the next succeeding Regular Season and
shall be updated once every two (2) months at all other times.
Section 4. Confirmation by the Players Association.
If the WNBA or a Team has reason to believe that an agent representing a player
in Contract negotiations is not a certified agent or is not the agent authorized to represent such
player, the WNBA may, at its election, request in writing from the Players Association
confirmation as to whether such agent is in fact the player's certified representative. If within
three (3) business days of the date the Players Association receives such written request, the
WNBA does not receive a written response from the Players Association stating that such agent
is not the player's certified representative, then the WNBA and any Team shall be free to act as
if the agent is the player's confirmed certified agent.
Section 5. WNBA Player as Agent.
No WNBA player may represent (or otherwise act as an agent for) any other
WNBA player.
