 ARTICLE V
STANDARD PLAYER CONTRACT
Section 1. Required Form.
The contract to be entered into by each player and the Team by which she is
employed shall be a Standard Player Contract in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit 1.
Section 2. Limitation on Amendments.
(a) Except as provided in Sections 3, 9, 10 and 11 of this Article and in
Article VII, Section 5, no amendments of any kind to the form or the terms of the Standard
Player Contract provided for by Section 1 of this Article shall be permitted.
(b) If a Team and a player enter into (i) a Standard Player Contract containing
an amendment not specifically permitted by this Agreement or (ii) a subsequent amendment to an
existing Player Contract when such amendment is not specifically permitted by this Agreement,
then such Contract or subsequent amendment, as the case may be, shall be disapproved by the
Commissioner and rendered null and void.
(c) Once executed by the player and the Team, a Player Contract may not be
amended or changed in any manner except pursuant to Section 3(e), (g) and (h)(iii) below or
Article VII, Section 5.
(d) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 2, a player may
unilaterally change the form of the Standard Player Contract by deleting paragraph 6(d) thereof
in its entirety.
Section 3. Allowable Amendments.
In their individual contract negotiations, a Veteran Player (but not a Rookie) and a
Team may amend the provisions of a Standard Player Contract, but only in the following
respects:
 (a) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 1 to a Standard
Player Contract) setting forth the Base Salary to be paid to the player for each Season of the
Contract for rendering the services described in such Contract.
(b) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 2 to a Standard
Player Contract) stating that the Base Salary provided for by the Standard Player Contract shall
be, in whole or in part, and subject to any conditions or limitations, protected in the event that the
Contract is terminated by the Team by reason of the player's: (i) lack of skill; (ii) disability or
unfitness to play skilled basketball resulting from a basketball-related injury ("basketball-related
injury"); (iii) disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball resulting from any injury or illness
suffered by the player during a WNBA Season ("in-Season injury or illness"); and/or
(iv) disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball resulting from any injury or illness suffered
by the player during the term of the Contract ("injury or illness"); provided, however, that no
Team, at any one time, may be a party to, or have any obligations to pay Base Salary under,
more than six (6) Player Contracts that contain Base Salary protection of any kind during the
then-current or any future Season. For purposes of the preceding sentence: (i) any outstanding
Offer Sheet that provides for Base Salary protection of any kind shall count against the per-team
limit of six (6) Player Contracts containing Base Salary protection of any kind; (ii) the Player
Contract of a player who has been suspended for the entire final Season of such Player Contract
pursuant to Article XIV, Section 6 or XX, Section 1(c) shall not count against the per-team limit
of six (6) Player Contracts containing Base Salary protection of any kind; and (iii) any option
exercised by a team pursuant to Section 4(a) below and Article VI, Section 4 shall not count
against the per-team limit of six (6) Player Contracts containing Base Salary protection of any
kind.
 (c) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 3 to a Standard
Player Contract) limiting or eliminating the player's right to receive her Base Salary (in
accordance with Sections 6(a)(i)(y) and 6(c) of this Article) when the player's disability or
unfitness to play skilled basketball is caused by the re-injury of one or more injuries sustained
prior to, or by the aggravation of one or more conditions that existed prior to, the execution of
the Standard Player Contract providing for such Base Salary.
(d) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 5 to a Standard
Player Contract) establishing that the player must report for and submit to a physical examination
to be performed by a physician designated by the Team, subject to the provisions of Section 14(i)
below.
(e) By agreeing upon provisions for the purpose of terminating an already-
existing Standard Player Contract prior to the expiration of its stated term, stating as follows:
(i) the Team will request waivers on the player immediately following the Commissioner's
approval of such amendment; and (ii) should the player clear waivers and her Contract thereupon
be terminated, the amount of any Base Salary protection contained in the Contract will
immediately be reduced or eliminated. In addition to the foregoing, the parties may also agree
that as a result of the termination of the Contract, the Team's right of set-off under Article XXX
of this Agreement will be modified or eliminated.
(f) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 7 to a Standard
Player Contract) stating that the Contract will be traded to another Team within forty-eight (48)
hours of its execution, such trade and the consummation of such trade to be conditions precedent
to the validity of the Contract.
 (g) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 8 to any Standard
Player Contract other than a Rookie Scale Contract) setting forth lump sum bonuses to be paid as
a result of a player not exceeding agreed-upon limitations on the amount of time she will Play
Professional Basketball during an Off-Season, subject to the provisions of Section 17 below
("Time Off Bonuses").
(h) By agreeing upon provisions (to be set forth in Exhibit 9 to any Standard
Player Contract) entitling a player to earn compensation if the player's Standard Player Contract
is traded ("trade bonus") to another WNBA team subject to the following:
A trade bonus shall be payable only the first time that the Contract
is traded; provided, however, that if a Contract is signed in connection with an agreement to
trade the Contract in accordance with Article V, Section 3(f) and the Contract contains a trade
bonus, the bonus shall not apply to such initial trade but shall instead be payable only the second
time the Contract is traded.
A trade bonus shall not exceed ten percent (10%) of the Base
Salary remaining to be earned by the player pursuant to the Contract at the time of the trade.
The only allowable amendments to Exhibit 9 to a Standard Player
Contract shall be the specification of the amount of the trade bonus to be paid to the player,
expressed as either (A) a specified percentage of the Base Salary remaining to be earned under
the Contract at the time of the trade, or (B) a specified dollar amount not to exceed a specified
percentage of Base Salary remaining to be earned under the Contract at the time of the trade.
A Contract that does not contain a trade bonus cannot be amended
to add a trade bonus, except that if the Contract is extended, the Contract may be amended
simultaneously to provide for a trade bonus that, notwithstanding subsection (i) above, shall be
payable only the first time such Contract is traded following the Season immediately preceding
the extended term of the Extension. In order to so provide, notwithstanding subsection (iii)
above, Exhibit 9 to the Extension must include the following sentence: "The foregoing trade
bonus shall not be applicable to any trade prior to the end of the [___] Season, but shall instead
be payable only the first time this Contract is traded following the [___] Season." The Season to
be included where brackets are indicated in the foregoing language shall be the Season
immediately preceding the first Season covered by the extended term of the Extension.
A Contract that contains a trade bonus cannot be amended to
change such trade bonus, except that in connection with the trade of such Contract, the player
and the assignor Team may agree to amend the Contract to waive all or any portion of such trade
bonus.
In no event shall a trade bonus in a Contract be payable more than
once.
No Contract or Extension entered into by a player who, at the time
of signing such Contract or Extension, has fewer than six (6) Years of Service may contain an
Exhibit 9.
Section 4. Rookie Scale Contracts.
(a) The Rookie Scale Contract between a Team and a Draft Rookie drafted in
any of the 2020-2027 WNBA Drafts: (i) shall be for an initial term covering three (3) Seasons
and the immediately succeeding Off-Seasons; (ii) shall provide a Base Salary in each season as
set forth in Article VIII of the Agreement; (iii) shall not contain Base Salary protection of any
kind (other than the contingent protection contained in the Option Year); (iv) may contain the
amendments authorized by Sections 3(c) and 3(d) above; and (v) shall contain an option (to be
set forth in Exhibit 4 to a Standard Player Contract) that may be exercised by the Team to extend
the term of the Contract for one additional twelve-month period beyond its initial term. Such
option shall be exercisable by the Team, in its sole discretion, by written notice to the player or
her representative on or before the May 15 following the second Season covered by the Contract.
If such option is exercised by the Team, the terms and conditions of the Contract for the Option
Year will be the same as those for the third year of the Contract, except that the Base Salary to be
paid to the player for the Option Year (x) shall be increased by an amount equal to fifteen
percent (15%) of the player's Base Salary for the second year of the Contract above the player's
Base Salary for the third year of the Contract; and (y) shall be fully protected for lack of skill and
injury or illness upon the Team's exercise of the option.
(b) The Rookie Scale Contract between a Team and a Non-Draft Rookie:
(i) shall be for an initial term of up to but no more than two (2) Seasons (and the immediately
succeeding Off-Seasons); (ii) shall provide a Base Salary in each season as set forth in Article
VIII of the Agreement; (iii) shall not contain Base Salary protection of any kind; and (iv) may
contain the amendments authorized by Sections 3(c) and 3(d) above.
(c) If a Rookie Scale Contract is entered into during any Regular Season, the
player's Base Salary (as set forth in Article VIII) for such Season shall be reduced so as to equal
the Base Salary as set forth in Article VIII multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
number of days remaining in the Regular Season when the Contract is executed and the
denominator of which is the total number of days of the Regular Season. If a Rookie Scale
Contract with a Draft Rookie is entered into after the conclusion of the first Regular Season
following the Draft in which such player was drafted, such Contract shall provide a Base Salary
in each season as set forth in Article VIII for players drafted in the same draft position in the
Draft immediately prior to the first Regular Season covered by such Contract.
(d) Pre-existing Sponsorship, Endorsement and Licensing Agreements.
Each player must disclose all sponsorship, endorsement and licensing agreements
(including all agreements with respect to footwear) that the player entered into prior to the
execution of her Player Contract and that will be in effect during the term of such Contract.
Such agreements shall be listed in Exhibit 6 to a Standard Player Contract, and copies of the
agreements shall be attached to that Exhibit. Except as required under the License Agreement,
players shall not be required to disclose the financial terms of such agreements and may redact
such terms from the agreements attached to the Exhibit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
footwear agreement shall be treated as a Qualifying Shoe Deal unless the player provides a
written representation (in Exhibit 6 or otherwise) that such agreement is an exclusive agreement
between the player and a shoe manufacturer that provides for at least five thousand dollars
(\$5,000) in cash payments annually to the player.
Section 5. Base Salary Protection.
(a) Lack of Skill.
When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Salary provided for
by a Standard Player Contract in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team by reason of
the player's lack of skill, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or limitations
set forth in Exhibit 2 to the Standard Player Contract, and subject further to Article XXXIII,
Section 3(b), and notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6(a)(i)(x), 6(a)(i)(y), 6(e), and 6(f)
of this Article, the termination of such Contract by the Team on account of the player's failure to
exhibit sufficient skill or competitive ability shall in no way affect the player's right to receive,
in whole or in part, the Base Salary payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 to such Contract; provided,
that: (i) such lack of skill does not result from the player's participation in activities prohibited
by paragraph 10 of the Standard Player Contract, attempted suicide, intentional self-inflicted
injury, abuse of alcohol, use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled substance, abuse of or
addiction to prescription drugs, conduct occurring during the commission of any felony for
which the player is convicted (including a plea of guilty, no contest or nolo contendere),
participation in any riot, insurrection or war or other military activities, or failure to comply with
the requirements of Article XX, Sections 1, 2(a) and 2(b); and (ii) at the time of the player's
failure to render playing services, the player is not in material breach of such Contract.
(b) Basketball-Related Injury.
When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Salary provided for
in a Standard Player Contract in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team by reason of
the player's disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball resulting from a basketball-related
injury, such agreement shall mean that, subject to any conditions or limitations set forth in
Exhibit 2 and/or Exhibit 3 to such Contract (in addition to the conditions and limitations set forth
in this Article V, Section 5(b)), and subject further to Article XXXIII, Section 3(b), and
notwithstanding the provisions of Sections 6(a)(i)(y), 6(c), 6(d), 6(e) and 6(f) of this Article, the
termination of such Contract by the Team because the player has been disabled and/or is unfit to
play skilled basketball as a direct result of an injury sustained while participating in any
basketball practice or game played for the Team, or in any other basketball activity in which the
player is required to participate under her Player Contract, shall in no way affect the player's
right to receive, in whole or in part, the Base Salary payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 of such
Contract; provided, however, that (i) such injury does not result from the player's participation in
activities prohibited by paragraph 10 of the Standard Player Contract, attempted suicide,
intentional self-inflicted injury, abuse of alcohol, use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled
substance, abuse of or addiction to prescription drugs, conduct occurring during the commission
of any felony for which the player is convicted (including a plea of guilty, no contest or nolo
contendere) or participation in any riot, insurrection or war or other military activities, or failure
to comply with the requirements of Article XX, Sections 1, 2(a) and 2(b); (ii) at the time of such
injury, the player is not in material breach of such Contract; (iii) if the Team, for its own benefit,
seeks to procure an insurance policy covering the player's injury, the player cooperates with the
Team in procuring such an insurance policy, including by, among other things, supplying all
information requested of her, completing application forms, or otherwise and submitting to all
examinations and tests requested of her by or on behalf of the insurance company in connection
with the Team's efforts to procure such policy; and (iv) if the Team, for its own benefit, has
procured such an insurance policy, the player cooperates (in the manner described above) with
the Team and the insurance company in the processing of the Team's claim under such policy.
(c) In-Season Injury or Illness.
When the Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Salary provided
for in a Standard Player Contract in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team by reason
of the player's disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball resulting from any injury, illness
or disability suffered by the player during a WNBA Season, such agreement shall mean that,
subject to any conditions or limitations set forth in Exhibit 2 and/or Exhibit 3 to such Contract
(in addition to the conditions and limitations set forth in this Article V, Section 5(c)), and subject
further to Article XXXIII, Section 3(b), and notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
6(a)(i)(y), 6(c), 6(d), 6(e) and 6(f) of this Article, the termination of such Contract by the Team
on account of an injury, illness or disability suffered or sustained by the player during the
WNBA Season shall in no way affect the player's right to receive, in whole or in part, the Base
Salary payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 of such Contract; provided, however, that (i) such injury or
illness does not result from the player's participation in activities prohibited by paragraph 10 of
the Standard Player Contract, attempted suicide, intentional self-inflicted injury, abuse of
alcohol, use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled substance, abuse of or addiction to
prescription drugs, conduct occurring during the commission of any felony for which the player
is convicted (including a plea of guilty, no contest or nolo contendere) or participation in any
riot, insurrection or war or other military activities, or failure to comply with the requirements of
Article XX, Sections 1, 2(a) and 2(b); (ii) at the time of such injury, illness, or disability, the
player is not in material breach of such Contract; (iii) if the Team, for its own benefit, seeks to
procure an insurance policy covering the player's injury, illness and/or disability, the player

things, supplying all information requested of her, completing application forms, or otherwise
and submitting to all examinations and tests requested of her by or on behalf of the insurance
company in connection with the Team's efforts to procure such policy; and (iv) if the Team, for
its own benefit, has procured such an insurance policy, the player cooperates (in the manner
described above) with the Team and the insurance company in the processing of the Team's
claim under such policy.
(d) Injury or Illness.
When a Team agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Salary provided for
in a Standard Player Contract in the event such Contract is terminated by the Team by reason of
the player's disability or unfitness to play skilled basketball resulting from any injury, illness or
disability suffered by the player during the term of her Contract, such agreement shall mean that,
subject to any conditions or limitations set forth in Exhibit 2 and/or Exhibit 3 to such Contract
(in addition to the conditions and limitations set forth in this Article V, Section 5(d)), and subject
further to Article XXXIII, Section 3(b), and notwithstanding the provisions of Sections
6(a)(i)(y), 6(c), 6(d), 6(e) and 6(f) of this Article, the termination of such Contract by the Team
on account of an injury, illness or disability suffered or sustained by the player during the term of
her Contract shall in no way affect the player's right to receive, in whole or in part, the Base
Salary payable pursuant to Exhibit 1 of such Contract; provided, however, that (i) such injury or
illness does not result from the player's participation in activities prohibited by paragraph 10 of
the Standard Player Contract, attempted suicide, intentional self-inflicted injury, abuse of
alcohol, use of any Prohibited Substance or controlled substance, abuse of or addiction to
prescription drugs, conduct occurring during the commission of any felony for which the player

riot, insurrection or war or other military activities, or failure to comply with the requirements of
Article XX, Sections 1, 2(a) and 2(b); (ii) such injury, illness or disability does not occur during
any period in which the player is under an Off-Season Playing Obligation (with such period
deemed to commence, for the purposes of this subsection (ii), no sooner than the start of the
applicable Off-Season) and does not result, directly or indirectly, from the activities engaged in
by the player in connection with her satisfaction of such Off-Season Playing Obligation; (iii) at
the time of such injury, illness, or disability, the player is not in material breach of such Contract;
(iv) if the Team, for its own benefit, seeks to procure an insurance policy covering the player's
injury, illness and/or disability, the player cooperates with the Team in procuring such an
insurance policy, including by, among other things, supplying all information requested of her,
completing application forms, or otherwise and submitting to all examinations and tests
requested of her by or on behalf of the insurance company in connection with the Team's efforts
to procure such policy; and (v) if the Team, for its own benefit, has procured such an insurance
policy, the player cooperates with the Team (in the manner described above) and the insurance
company in the processing of the Team's claim under such policy.
(e) No agreement by a Team to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Salary
provided for by a Standard Player Contract shall require (or be construed as requiring) such
Team to continue the player on the Team's roster; nor shall any such agreement afford the player
any right to continue, or to be deemed as having continued, on such Team's roster for any
purpose.
(f) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, when a Team
agrees to protect, in whole or in part, the Base Salary provided for by a Standard Player Contract,
and such protection is contingent on the satisfaction of a condition set forth in Exhibit 2 to that
Contract, such protection shall be applicable and effective only if the Contract has not previously
been terminated at the time such condition is satisfied.
Section 6. Termination of Standard Player Contract.
(a) In addition to any other grounds for termination that are expressly set forth
in this Agreement or the Standard Player Contract, a Player Contract may be terminated by a
Team at any time without further obligation on the part of either party, upon written notice to the
player, if she:
at any time, in the sole and absolute discretion of the Team's
management, fails to exhibit sufficient skill or competitive ability to qualify to continue as a
player on the Team; provided, however, that (x) if the Player Contract is terminated by a Team,
in accordance with the provisions of this subparagraph, during the period commencing on the
day after the Mid-Point of a Regular Season then, subject to Article XXXIII, Section 3(b), the
player shall continue to receive the remainder of her full Base Salary for such Season; and (y) if
the Player Contract is terminated by a Team, in accordance with the provisions of this
subparagraph, and the player, at the time of such termination, is unfit to play skilled basketball as
the result of an injury resulting directly from her rendering playing services for the Team during
a Season covered by the Contract then, subject to Article XXXIII, Section 3(b), she will continue
to receive the remainder of her full Base Salary, less all workers' compensation benefits (which,
to the extent permitted by law, and if not deducted from the player's Base Salary by the Team,
shall be deemed as having been assigned to the Team) and any insurance provided for by the
Team paid or payable to the player by reason of such injury, until such time as the player is fit to
play skilled basketball, but not beyond the Season during which such termination occurred;
at any time fails, refuses, or neglects to render the services called
for under her Standard Player Contract or in any other manner materially breaches her Standard
Player Contract;
at any time fails, refuses or neglects to conform her personal
conduct to standards of good citizenship, good moral character, and good sportsmanship; or
at any time commits a significant and inexcusable physical attack
against any official or employee of the Team or the WNBA (other than another player), or any
person in attendance at any WNBA game or event, considering the totality of the circumstances,
including (but not limited to) the degree of provocation (if any) that may have led to the attack,
the nature and scope of the attack, the player's state of mind at the time of the attack, and the
extent of any injury resulting from the attack; or
 at any time fails, refuses or neglects to keep herself in first-class
physical condition.
(b) Prior to terminating a player's Standard Player Contract, a Team must
offer to assign the player to the other WNBA Teams pursuant to the WNBA waiver procedures
then in effect; provided, however, that a Team shall not offer to assign the player pursuant to the
waiver procedures if the Contract being terminated is a 7-Day Contract or a Replacement
Contract.
(c) Subject to Article XXXIII, Section 3(b), if a Team terminates a player's
Standard Player Contract by reason of the player's failure to render her services hereunder due to
a disability caused by an injury to the player resulting directly from her rendering playing
services for the Team or WNBA and rendering her unfit to play skilled basketball, and notice of
such injury is given by the player as provided in Article XX, Section 2, the player shall be
entitled to receive the remainder of her full Base Salary for the Season in which the injury was
sustained, less all workers' compensation benefits (which, to the extent permitted by law, and if
not deducted from the player's Base Salary by the Team, shall be deemed as having been
assigned to the Team) and any insurance provided for by the Team paid or payable to the player
by reason of such injury.
(d) Notwithstanding the provision of Section 6(c) above, if a Team terminates
a player's Standard Player Contract prior to the first game of a Regular Season by reason of the
player's failure to render her services thereunder due to an injury or condition sustained or
suffered during a preceding Season, or after such Season but prior to the Player's participation in
any basketball practice or game played for the Team, payment of the player's lodging and meal
expense allowance during the training camp period, payment of the reasonable traveling
expenses of the player to her home city, and the expert training and coaching provided by the
Team to the player shall be full payment to the player.
(e) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6(a)(i) or Section 6(c) above, if
a Team terminates a player's Standard Player Contract that is a Training Camp Contract (as that
term is defined in Article VII, Section 2(g)) prior to the first game of the Regular Season by
reason of (i) the player's lack of skill where at the time of such termination, the player is unfit to
play skilled basketball as the result of an injury resulting directly from her rendering playing
services for the Team, or (ii) the player's failure to render her services due to an injury to the
player resulting directly from her rendering playing services for the Team or WNBA and
rendering her unfit to play skilled basketball, then, in either case, payment of the player's lodging
and meal expense allowance during the training camp period, payment of the reasonable
traveling expenses of the player to her home city, and the expert training and coaching provided
by the Team to the player shall be full payment to the player; provided, however, that: (i) the
Team shall pay directly or reimburse any medical expenses directly related to the injury
sustained (or aggravated) during such Season pursuant to Article XX, Section 4, and (ii) if the
player elects to remain in the Team's home city during her rehabilitation and/or recovery from
such injury, the Team will provide reasonable housing and reasonable local transportation (e.g.,
two players per car) for such player during such rehabilitation and/or recovery period not to
exceed eight (8) weeks from the termination of such Training Camp Contract.
(f) If a Team terminates a player's Standard Player Contract during the
training camp period, and the provisions of Section 6(a)(i)(y) above do not apply, payment of the
player's lodging and meal expense allowance during the training camp period, payment of the
reasonable traveling expenses of the player to her home city, and the expert training and
coaching provided by the Team to the player shall be full payment to the player.
(g) Subject to Sections 6(a)(i)(x), 6(a)(i)(y) and 6(c) above, if a Team
terminates a player's Standard Player Contract during any Regular Season, all obligations of the
Team to pay compensation thereunder shall cease on the date of termination, except the player
shall be entitled to receive, as full compensation for her services thereunder, a prorated portion of
her Base Salary based upon the number of days of the Regular Season that such player was under
Contract with the Team. Notwithstanding the preceding sentence, in circumstances within which
a Team requests waivers on a player prior to the first day of a Regular Season but the player's
Contract is terminated on or after the first day of the Regular Season, the Team's obligations to
the player shall be as set forth in Section 6(f) above rather than as set forth in this Section 6(g).
(h) In the event of an alleged default by a Team in the payments to the player
provided for in such player's Standard Player Contract, or in the event of an alleged failure by a
Team to perform any other material obligation that it agreed to perform under such Contract, the
player shall notify the Team in writing of the facts constituting such alleged default or alleged
failure. If the Team shall not cause such alleged default or alleged failure to be remedied within
ten (10) business days after receipt of such written notice, the player shall have the right to
request that the dispute concerning such alleged default or alleged failure be referred
immediately to arbitration in accordance with Article XXII, Section 4 of this Agreement. If, as a
result of such arbitration, an award issues in favor of the player, and if the Team does not comply
with such award within ten (10) business days of its receipt thereof (unless such award has been
stayed or reversed by appropriate legal process), the player shall have the right, by a further
written notice to the Team, to terminate her Standard Player Contract.
Section 7. Minimum Player Salary.
(a) Except with respect to 7-Day Contracts provided for in Section 9 below,
Rest-of-Season Contracts provided for in Section 10 below, Replacement Contracts provided for
in Section 11 below, and Rookie Scale Contracts, no Standard Player Contract covering the
following Seasons shall provide a Base Salary of less than the following amounts:
Years 2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027

(b) Nothing in this Section 7 shall alter the respective rights and liabilities of a
player and a Team, as provided for in this Agreement or a Standard Player Contract, with respect
to the termination of a Player Contract.
(c) Every Player Contract entered into between a player and Team that is
intended to provide for only the Minimum Player Salary for one or more Seasons must contain
the following sentence in Exhibit 1 of such Contract and shall be deemed amended in the manner
described in such sentence: "This Contract is intended to provide for a Base Salary for the
________ Season(s) equal to the Minimum Player Salary for such Season(s) and shall be deemed
amended to the extent necessary to so provide."
(d) In the event that the Base Salary in any Player Contract entered into prior
to January 17, 2020 and covering the 2020 Season and, if applicable, any Season thereafter (an
"Existing Contract") is below the Minimum Annual Salary, the Base Salary in such Player
Contract shall be automatically adjusted so that the Base Salary in 2020 and, if applicable, any
Season thereafter shall equal the Minimum Annual Salary. Nothing herein shall in any way
prevent a Team from terminating an Existing Contract at any time.
Section 8. Maximum Player Salary
No Standard Player Contract shall provide a Base Salary in any Season covered
thereunder of more than the Maximum Player Salary.
(a) For: (i) Player Contracts entered into between a Qualifying Veteran Free
Agent with six (6) or more Years of Service (or, beginning with the 2021 Salary Cap Year, five
(5) or more Years of Service) and her Prior Team; (ii) Player Contracts entered into between a
Veteran Free Agent who is designated as a Core Player and her Prior Team; (iii) Extensions of
Rookie Scale Contracts with Draft Rookies; and (iv) Veteran Extensions with a player who, at

under one or more Player Contracts covering some or all of each of the two preceding Seasons
and either played exclusively with her Prior Team during such two Seasons, or, if she played
with more than one Team during such period, changed Teams only (x) by means of assignment,
or (y) by signing with her Prior Team during the first of the two Seasons, the Maximum Player
Salary shall be:
2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
\$215,000 \$221,450 \$228,094 \$234,936 \$241,984 \$249,244 \$256,721 \$264,423
(b) For all other Player Contracts, the Maximum Player Salary shall be:
2020 2021 2022 2023 2024 2025 2026 2027
\$185,000 \$190,550 \$196,267 \$202,154 \$208,219 \$214,466 \$220,900 \$227,527
(c) The Maximum Player Salary for any Contract entered into during any
Regular Season hereunder shall be reduced so as to equal the Maximum Player Salary multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of days remaining in the Regular Season
when the Contract is executed and the denominator of which is the total number of days of the
Regular Season.
(d) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if a trade of a
Standard Player Contract would, by reason of a trade bonus contained in such Contract, cause the
player's Salary (including allocated trade bonus amount) in any Salary Cap Year to exceed the
player's applicable Maximum Player Salary, then such player's trade bonus (i.e., the amount of
the trade bonus payable to the player) shall be deemed amended to the extent necessary to ensure
that the player's Salary (including allocated trade bonus amount) in the current and all remaining
Salary Cap Years does not exceed the player's applicable Maximum Player Salary.
Section 9. 7-Day Contracts.
At any time after the Mid-Point of a Regular Season, a Team may enter into a
Player Contract with a player for seven (7) days (a "7-Day Contract"). The Base Salary provided
for by a 7-Day Contract shall not be less than the Minimum Player Salary. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Article V, Section 6 (including, but not limited to, Article V, Section
6(a)(i)(x), 6(a)(i)(y), or 6(b)), when a Team terminates a 7-Day Contract prior to the expiration
of the seven (7) days, the team shall pay to the player only such sums as set forth in Exhibit 1 to
such Contract. No team may enter into more than three (3) 7-Day-Contracts with the same
player in any one (1) Season. No Team may enter into a 7-day Contract if the length of such
Contract would extend to or past the date of the Team's last Regular Season game for such
Season.
Section 10. Rest-of-Season Contracts.
At any time after the first day of a WNBA Regular Season, a Team may enter into
a Player Contract that may provide Base Salary to a player only for the remainder of that Season
(a "Rest-of-Season Contract"). The Base Salary provided for in a Rest-of-Season Contract shall
not be less than the Minimum Player Salary. A Rest-of-Season Contract shall not contain Base
Salary protection of any kind.
Section 11. Replacement Contracts.
At any time beginning with the first day of the WNBA Regular Season, a Team
may enter into a Player Contract with a Replacement Player only for the remainder of that
Season pursuant to Article VII, Section 4 (a "Replacement Contract"). The Base Salary provided
for in a Replacement Contract shall be the Minimum Player Salary. A Replacement Contract
shall not contain Base Salary protection of any kind. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in
Article V, Section 6 (including, but not limited to, Article V, Section 6(a)(i)(x), 6(a)(i)(y) or
6(b)), when a Team terminates a Replacement Contract, the Team shall pay to the player only
such prorated portion of her Base Salary as was earned by her based upon the number of days of
the Regular Season that the player was under Contract with the Team. After the expiration or
termination of a Replacement Contract, the player shall become an Unrestricted Free Agent.
Section 12. Length of Veteran Player Contracts.
(a) Maximum Term. Except when a shorter term is expressly provided for
elsewhere in this Agreement, a Player Contract may cover, in the aggregate, up to but no more
than three (3) Seasons (and the immediately succeeding Off-Seasons) from the date such
Contract is signed; provided, however, that (a) a Contract between a Qualifying Veteran Free
agent and her Prior Team may cover, in the aggregate, up to but no more than four (4) Seasons
(and the immediately succeeding Off-Seasons), (b) a Rookie Scale Contract shall cover, in the
aggregate, three (3) Seasons plus an Option Year, and (c) an Extension of a Rookie Scale
Contract may cover, in the aggregate, up to but no more than four (4) Seasons from the date such
Extension is signed.
(b) Computation of Time. For purposes of Section 12(a) above, if a Player
Contract or Extension is signed after the beginning of a Season, the Season in which the Contract
or Extension is signed shall be counted as one (1) full Season covered by the Contract or
Extension.
Section 13. Conformity of Standard Player Contracts.
All Standard Player Contracts (and any Team Marketing and Promotional
Agreements) that were entered into by a Team and any player (and any WNBA Marketing and
Promotional Agreements that were entered into by the WNBA and any player) prior to the
effective date of this Agreement shall remain in full force and effect for their stated terms and for
any option years, except that those Contracts shall be deemed amended in such manner to require
the parties to comply with all terms of this Agreement, including the terms of the Standard
Player Contract annexed hereto as Exhibit 1. All Standard Player Contracts shall be subject to
the terms of this Agreement, which shall supersede the terms of any Standard Player Contract
inconsistent herewith. No Standard Player Contract shall provide for the waiver by a player or
the Team of any benefits or the sacrifice of any rights to which the player or the Team is entitled
by virtue of a Standard Player Contract or this Agreement.
Section 14. General.
(a) (i) Subject to Section 16 below, any oral or written agreement
between a player and a Team concerning terms and conditions of employment shall be reduced
to writing in the form of a Standard Player Contract or an amendment thereto as soon as
practicable. Immediately upon the consummation of any such oral or written agreement, the
Team shall notify the WNBA by email and provide the WNBA with all terms of such agreement.
Following its receipt of such notice, the WNBA shall provide the same notice to the Players
Association as soon as practicable.
Notwithstanding subsection (a)(i) above, neither the WNBA, any
Team, nor the Players Association or any player shall contend that any agreement concerning
terms and conditions of employment is binding upon the player or the Team until a Player
Contract embodying such terms and conditions has been duly executed by the parties. Nothing
herein is intended to affect (A) any authority of the Commissioner to approve or disapprove
Player Contracts, or (B) the effect of the Commissioner's approval or disapproval on the validity
of such Player Contracts.
A violation of the first sentence of subsection (a)(i) above may be
considered evidence of a violation of Article XV.
(b) No player shall attend the regular training camp of any Team or participate
in any game or organized practices with the Team at any time, unless she is a party to a Player
Contract then in effect.
(c) The only form of Salary that a Team may pay a player under her Player
Contract is cash in U.S. dollars via a check made payable to the player or via a direct deposit
made to the player's bank account. Compensation of any other kind is prohibited.
(d) No Team shall make any direct or indirect payment of any money,
property, investments, loans, or anything else of value for fees or otherwise to an agent, attorney,
or representative of a player (for or in connection with such person's representation of such
player); nor shall any Player Contract provide for such payment. No Player shall assign or
otherwise transfer to any third party her right to receive Salary from the Team under her Player
Contract. Nothing in this subsection (d), however, shall prevent a Team from sending a player's
regular paycheck (made payable to the player) to a player's agent, attorney, or representative if
so instructed in writing by the player.
(e) No Team shall make any direct or indirect payment of any money,
property, investments, loans, or anything else of value to: (i) any basketball team not in the
WNBA, or (ii) any other entity, organization, representative, or person, for the purpose of
inducing a player to enter into a Player Contract or in connection with receiving the right to enter
into a Player Contract.
(f) If a Team ("Prior Team") terminates a player's Player Contract, then the
Prior Team may not enter into another Player Contract with the player during the period
commencing on the date of termination and continuing through (i) the tenth day (10th) day
following such termination if such termination occurs during the Regular Season, or (ii) the tenth
(10th) day of the first Regular Season following such termination if such termination occurs
during the Off-Season or the training camp period; provided, however, that (i) any Team that
terminates a player from the period beginning seven (7) days before the Mid-Point of the Regular
Season and continuing through the Mid-Point of the Regular Season may enter into a Player
Contract with such player after the Mid-Point of the Regular Season, provided that such Player
Contract is a 7-Day Contract and/or a Rest-of-Season Contract at the applicable Minimum Player
Salary, (ii) if a Team terminates one or more Player Contracts in order to create Room for an
Offer Sheet, and the ROFR Team subsequently exercises its Right of First Refusal and enters
into a Contract with that player, the Team shall immediately thereafter be permitted to enter into
a Player Contract with any of the players whose Contracts it had terminated to create Room for
the Offer Sheet, and (iii) if a Team terminates a Player Contract and subsequently applies for,
and is granted, a Hardship Exception or Emergency Hardship Exception, the Team shall,
immediately following the grant of the Exception, be permitted to enter into a Replacement
Contract with such player.
(g) On a bi-weekly basis, the WNBA shall provide to the Players Association
copies of all new Standard Player Contracts.
(h) A Team's termination of a Player Contract by reason of the player's "lack
of skill" (under Section 5(a) of this Article V) shall be interpreted to include a termination based
on the Teams' determination that, in view of the player's level of skill (in the sole opinion of the
Team), the Base Salary paid (or to be paid) to a player is no longer commensurate with the
Team's financial plans or needs. The forgoing sentence shall not affect any post-termination
obligation to pay Base Salary that may result from Base Salary protection provisions included in
a Player Contract.
(i) The following provisions shall govern an agreement (to be set forth in
Exhibit 5 to a Player Contract) establishing that the player must report for and submit to a
physical examination to be performed by a physician designated by the Team:
The player must report for such physical examination at the time
designated by the Team (which shall be no later than the third business day following the
execution of the Contract), and must, upon reporting, supply all information reasonably
requested of her, provide complete and truthful answers to all questions posed to her (it being
agreed that only questions reasonable and medically appropriate may be posed), and submit to all
reasonable and medically appropriate examinations and tests. The determination of whether the
player has passed the physical examination shall be made by the Team in its sole discretion; and
a Team shall have the right to determine in good faith that a player has failed to pass the physical
examination due to the risk of a future injury, illness or other health condition notwithstanding
that the player is currently able to play. If the player does not pass the physical examination, the
Team shall so notify the player no later than the sixth business day following the execution of the
Contract.
The Team's determination that the player has passed the physical
examination shall be a condition precedent to the validity of the Contract. Accordingly, and
without limiting the generality of the preceding sentence, until such time as a player has passed
the physical examination, the prohibitions set forth in Section 14(b) above shall continue to
apply to the Team and player.
A Required Tender or a Qualifying Offer may contain an Exhibit
5. If a player accepts such a Required Tender or Qualifying Offer but does not pass the required
physical examination, the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer shall be deemed to have been
withdrawn, which shall have the consequences described in Article XIII, Section 5 or Article VI,
as the case may be.
(j) A player who knows she has an injury, illness or condition (including
pregnancy) that renders, or she knows will likely render, her physically unable to perform the
playing services required under a Player Contract may not validly enter into such a Player
Contract without prior written disclosure of such injury, illness or condition to the Team.
Section 15. Void Contracts.
If a Player Contract fails to take effect or becomes void as a result of a
Commissioner disapproval, the player's failure to pass a physical examination conducted
pursuant to Exhibit 5 to such Contract, or the rescission of a trade conducted pursuant to Article
V, Section 3(f), then, in each such case:
(a) the Team shall continue to possess such rights with respect to the player as
the Team possessed at the time of the execution of the Contract, including, without limitation,
any such rights that the Team possessed pursuant to Article VI and Article XIII;
(b) any Required Tender or Qualifying Offer that was outstanding at the time
the Contract was executed shall continue in effect as if the Contract had not been executed
(including if the original deadline for accepting the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer expired
following the execution of the Contract), but for no fewer than three (3) business days following
the Commissioner's disapproval, the Team's issuance of notice to the player that she did not pass
the physical examination, or the rescission of such trade, as the case may be; and
(c) in the case of a player who does not pass a physical examination pursuant
to Exhibit 5: (i) the player shall not be permitted to accept such Required Tender or Qualifying
Offer for a period of two (2) business days following her receipt of notice from the Team that she
did not pass her physical examination, during which period the Team may elect to withdraw the
Required Tender or Qualifying Offer, which shall have the consequences described in Article VI
or Article XIII, as the case may be; and (ii) if the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer is not
withdrawn by the Team during this period, the Required Tender or Qualifying Offer shall
thereafter be deemed amended so as to eliminate any Exhibit 5 that may be contained therein.
Section 16. Moratorium.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, no player and Team may
negotiate over, or enter into, any oral or written agreement concerning terms and conditions of
the player's employment, or reduce any such agreement to writing in the form of a Player
Contract or amendment, between the end of the Regular Season and January 31 (the
"Moratorium Period"). The foregoing sentence shall not preclude (i) a player from accepting
any Required Tender or Qualifying Offer that is outstanding during the Moratorium Period, (ii) a
player and a Team from negotiating during the period beginning on January 15 and ending at the
conclusion of the Moratorium Period over the terms and conditions of a Player Contract or Offer
Sheet that may be entered into after the Moratorium Period, or (iii) a player and a Team from
entering into an amendment pursuant to Article V, Section 3(e) during the Moratorium Period.
Section 17. Time Off Bonuses.
(a) A Team shall be permitted to include a Time Off Bonus (as defined in
Section 3(g) above) in any new Player Contract that is entered into with a Veteran Player after
the date of this Agreement subject to the rules set forth below. A Player Contract entered into
with a Veteran Player (either currently existing or entered into after the date of this Agreement)
that does not contain a Time Off Bonus when signed may be amended to add one in accordance
with the rules set forth below.
(b) The following additional rules shall govern the inclusion of Time Off
Bonuses in Player Contracts:
A Team may sign one or more Player Contracts during each Salary
Cap Year and/or enter into amendments of one or more previously-signed Player Contracts
during such Salary Cap Year that: (A) provide for a Time Off Bonus applicable to the Off-
Season following the first Season covered by such Player Contract or, in the case of amendment
of previously-signed Player Contracts, provide for a Time Off Bonus applicable to the Off-
Season following (a) the upcoming Season covered by such Player Contract if the amendment is
entered into prior to a Season or (b) the current Season if the amendment is entered into during a
Season (in each case, the "First Off-Season"); and (B) provide for Time Off Bonuses applicable
to the First Off-Season totaling no more than fifty thousand dollars (\$50,000).
In the event a Player Contract includes a Time Off Bonus
applicable to the First Off-Season, then the Contract may include (but is not required to include)
a Time Off Bonus applicable to each consecutive and subsequent Off-Season covered by the
Contract. For each Off-Season covered by the Player Contract after the First Off-Season, the
Time Off Bonus may increase or decrease in relation to the previous Off-Season's Time Off
Bonus, by no more than three percent (3%) of the Time Off Bonus for the First Off-Season.
Player Contracts that include a Time Off Bonus must specify in
Exhibit 8 to a Standard Player Contract the maximum number of days from zero (0) to ninety
(90) that the player will Play Professional Basketball (as defined in (vii) below) during each Off-
Season (as applicable) in order to earn the Time Off Bonus in respect of such Off-Season. In
order to earn a Time Off Bonus in respect of an Off-Season, the player must (A) if the player
enters into an Off-Season Playing Obligation, provide the Team with a copy of such Off-Season
Playing Obligation evidencing the player's agreement to limit the amount of time she will Play
Professional Basketball during such Off-Season in accordance with Exhibit 8 to her Standard
Player Contract; and (B) comply with the specific limitation contained in such Exhibit 8 during
such Off-Season. If a Player Contract provides for a Time Off Bonus, a Team and player shall
not be permitted at any time to amend the Contract to modify the agreed-upon limitations on the
amount of time the player will Play Professional Basketball during an Off-Season in order to
earn such Time Off Bonus. In addition, no Team may waive the requirement that the player
comply with the agreed-upon limitations with respect to any Off-Season.
 With respect to Player Contracts covering more than one Season
that include a Time Off Bonus in respect of more than one Off-Season, if a player fails to earn
her Time Off Bonus with respect to any Off-Season covered by the Contract, then the Time Off
Bonus in respect of each subsequent Off-Season (if any) covered by the Player Contract shall be
automatically cancelled and of no further force and effect.
If a player earns a Time Off Bonus in respect of an Off-Season but
was not on the active list of her Team (or any assignee Team) for the entirety of the Regular
Season preceding such Off-Season, the Time Off Bonus payable to such player shall be prorated
based upon the number of days of that Regular Season the player was on the active list of such
Team for such Regular Season; provided, however, that no such proration of the Time Off Bonus
will occur if (a) such player signed a Rest-of-Season Contract containing such Time Off Bonus
during the Regular Season preceding such Off-Season and completed the playing services
therein; or (b) the only period of time such player was not on the active list of her Team during
the Regular Season preceding such Off-Season was due to a suspension for on-court discipline.
In addition, a player shall not be eligible to earn a Time Off Bonus in respect of an Off-Season if
the player (a) failed to fulfill her Off-Season Playing Obligation by, without limitation, leaving
the Team to which she is under an Off-Season Playing Obligation early (i.e., prior to fulfilling
her Off-Season Playing Obligation during that Off-Season), and (b) would not have satisfied the
time limitation set forth in Exhibit 8 of her Player Contract absent such failure to fulfill her Off-
Season Playing Obligation.
All Time Off Bonuses for an Off-Season provided for in Player
Contracts that were not previously cancelled in accordance with subparagraph (iv) above
(whether or not the Time Off Bonus is earned by the player) shall be included for purposes of
determining a Team's Team Salary for the Salary Cap Year covering the Season preceding such
Off-Season.
For purposes of this Section 17, "Play Professional Basketball"
shall mean the period of time during an Off-Season during which: (a) the player is under contract
with a professional basketball team (other than a WNBA Team) and is obligated to provide
playing services for such team (without regard to whether such services are in fact provided); or
(b) the player is providing playing services to a non-WNBA team (including, without limitation,
a national team without regard to whether such services were pursuant to a contract or whether
the player was paid for such services), or the player would be providing playing services to a
non-WNBA team but for an injury sustained by the player while fulfilling her services to a non-
WNBA team. For purposes of the preceding sentence, "playing services" shall include, without
limitation, participation in any games or any training, conditioning or other workout activities.
Section 18. Wireless Microphones.
Upon reasonable request by her Team, the WNBA, or WNBA Enterprises, NBA
Properties, Inc., or NBA Media Ventures LLC (each of the foregoing, a "League-Related
Entity"), and subject to the conditions and limitations set forth below, a player shall wear a
wireless microphone during any game or practice, including warm-up periods and going to and
from the locker room to the playing floor. The rights in any audio captured by such microphone
shall belong to the WNBA or a League-Related Entity and may be used in any manner for
publicity or promotional purposes.
(a) The WNBA or a League-Related Entity will be responsible for placement
of the microphone on the player in a location and manner that minimizes interference with the
player's performance.
 (b) The audio captured by the wireless microphone worn by the player
("Player Audio") will be screened (including for profanity) and approved prior to airing by the
telecast producer.
(c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, Player Audio
shall not be used as the basis for the imposition of discipline upon any player.
