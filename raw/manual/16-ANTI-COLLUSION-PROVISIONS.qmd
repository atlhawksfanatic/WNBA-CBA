 ARTICLE XVI
ANTI-COLLUSION PROVISIONS
Section 1. No Collusion.
Subject to Section 2 below, no WNBA Team, its employees or agents, will enter
into any contracts, combinations or conspiracies, express or implied, with the WNBA or any
other WNBA Team, their employees or agents: (a) to negotiate or not to negotiate with any
Veteran or Rookie; (b) to submit or not to submit an Offer Sheet to any Restricted Free Agent;
(c) to offer or not to offer a Player Contract to any Free Agent; (d) to exercise or not to exercise a
Right of First Refusal; or (e) concerning the terms or conditions of employment offered to any
Veteran or Rookie.
Section 2. Non-Collusive Conduct.
The following is a non-exhaustive list of conduct that shall not be deemed a
violation of Section 1 above:
(a) the formulation and negotiation of collective bargaining proposals;
(b) agreements between Teams necessary to the assignment of a Player
Contract of a Veteran or the assignment of the exclusive negotiating rights to a Draft Rookie,
where such assignment is contingent upon (i) the signing by the Veteran of an extension to an
existing Player Contract, or (ii) the signing by the Draft Rookie of a new Player Contract;
provided, however, that if such contingency is fulfilled by the Veteran entering into an extended
Player Contract or the Draft Rookie entering into a new Player Contract, this subsection shall
only apply if the assignment is actually consummated;
(c) an agreement between Teams concerning the signing of a new Player
Contract by a Veteran Free Agent with her Prior Team, where such agreement is necessary for
the subsequent assignment of the new Player Contract between the agreeing Teams; provided,
however, that this Section 2(c) shall apply only if the subsequent assignment is consummated.
(d) the conduct authorized by the terms and conditions of the WNBA Draft;
(e) any action taken by the WNBA League Office to exclude from the
WNBA, suspend or discipline any player for any reason authorized or permitted by any
provision of this Agreement (this subsection, however, shall not affect any other rights of any
player or the Players Association to contest such action);
(f) conduct authorized by any provision of this Agreement by the WNBA
League Office, undertaken in good faith, that reflects a reasonable interpretation of this
Agreement or a Player Contract; or
(g) any disapproval by the Commissioner of a Player Contract, Extension or
other amendment.
Section 3. Individual Negotiations.
No WNBA Team shall fail or refuse to negotiate with, or enter into a Player
Contract with, any player who is free to negotiate and sign a Player Contract with any WNBA
Team, on any of the following grounds:
(a) that the player has previously been subject to the exclusive negotiating
rights obtained by another WNBA Team in a WNBA Draft; or
(b) that the player has become a Restricted Free Agent or an Unrestricted Free
Agent; or
(c) that the Player is or has been subject to a Right of First Refusal.
The fact that a Team has not negotiated with, made any offers to, or entered into
any Player Contracts with players who are free to negotiate and sign Player Contracts with any
Team, shall not, by itself, be deemed proof that such Team failed or refused to negotiate with,
make any offers to, or enter into any Player Contracts with any players on any of the prohibited
grounds referred to in this Section 3.
Section 4. League Disclosures.
The WNBA League Office shall not knowingly communicate or disclose, directly
or indirectly, to any WNBA Team that another WNBA Team has negotiated with or is
negotiating with any Restricted Free Agent, unless and until an Offer Sheet (as defined in Article
VI, Section 6(b)) shall have been given to the ROFR Team (as defined in Article VI, Section
5(a)), or any Free Agent prior to the execution of a Player Contract with that player.
Section 5. Enforcement of Anti-Collusion Provisions.
(a) Any player, or the Players Association acting on behalf of a player or
players, may bring an action before the Arbitrator alleging a violation of Article XVI, Section 1
of this Agreement. Issues of relief and liability shall be determined in the same proceeding
(including the amount of damages, pursuant to Section 9 below, if any). The complaining party
will bear the burden of demonstrating by a clear preponderance of the evidence that the
challenged conduct was in violation of Article XVI, Section 1 of this Agreement and caused
economic injury to such player(s); provided, however, that the Players Association may, in the
absence of economic injury to any player, bring an action before the Arbitrator claiming a
violation of Section 1 above (which must be proved by a clear preponderance of the evidence)
and seeking only declaratory relief or a direction to cease and desist from the challenged
conduct.
 (b) The provisions of this Agreement are not intended to create any
substantive rights in any party, other than as provided for herein. This Agreement may be
enforced, and any alleged violations may be remedied, only as provided for herein.
Section 6. Satisfaction of Burden of Proof.
The failure by a Team or Teams to submit Offer Sheets to Restricted Free Agents,
or to make offers or sign Contracts for the playing services of a Free Agent shall not, by itself or
in combination only with evidence about the playing skills of the player(s) not receiving such
offers or contracts, satisfy the burden of proof set forth in Section 5 above. However, such
evidence may support a finding of a violation of Section 1 above, but only in combination with
other evidence that either by itself or in combination with the evidence referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence indicates that the challenged conduct was in violation of Section
1 above and, except in cases where the Players Association seeks only declaratory relief or a
direction to cease and desist from the challenged conduct, caused economic injury to such
player(s).
Section 7. Summary Judgment.
The Arbitrator may, at any time following the conclusion of any permitted
discovery, determine whether or not the complainant's evidence is sufficient to raise a genuine
issue of material fact capable of satisfying the standards imposed by Sections 5 and 6 above. If
the Arbitrator determines that complainant's evidence is not so sufficient, he or she shall dismiss
the action. In considering the sufficiency of the complainant's evidence, the Arbitrator may
consider documentary evidence and affidavits submitted by the parties.
Section 8. Remedies for Economic Injury.
In the event that an individual player or players, or the Players Association acting
on her or their behalf, successfully proves a violation of Section 1 above that has caused
economic injury, the player or players determined by the Arbitrator to have suffered economic
injury as a result of the violation will have the right:
(a) to terminate her (or their) existing Player Contract(s) at her (or their)
option (however, such termination shall not take effect until the conclusion of a then ongoing
WNBA Season, if any). Such right of termination must be exercised by the player within thirty
(30) days therefrom. If, at the time the Player Contract is terminated, such player would have
been an Unrestricted Free Agent pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement, she shall
immediately become an Unrestricted Free Agent. If, at the time the Player Contract is
terminated, such player would have been a Restricted Free Agent pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement, such player shall immediately become a Restricted Free Agent upon such
termination; however, any such player may choose to reinstate her Player Contract at any time up
until April 15 of that year; and
(b) to recover damages as described in Section 9 below. However, if the
player terminates her Player Contract under subsection (a) above and does not reinstate it
pursuant thereto, she may not recover damages for the period after such termination takes effect.
A player who does not terminate her contract, or who reinstates it pursuant to subsection (a)
above, may recover damages for the entire period of her injury.
Section 9. Calculation of Damages.
Upon any finding of a violation of Section 1 above that has caused economic
injury, compensatory damages (i.e., the amount by which any player has been injured as a result
of such violation) and non-compensatory damages (i.e., the amount exceeding compensatory
damages) shall be awarded as follows:
(a) Two (2) times the amount of compensatory damages, in the event that all
of the Teams found to have violated Section 1 above have committed such a violation for the
first time. Any Team found to have committed such a violation for the first time shall be jointly
and severally liable for two (2) times the amount of compensatory damages.
(b) Three (3) times the amount of compensatory damages, in the event that
any of the Teams found to have violated Section 1 above have committed such a violation for the
second time. In the event that damages are awarded pursuant to this subsection (b): (i) any Team
found to have committed such a violation for the first time shall be jointly and severally liable
for two (2) times the amount of compensatory damages; and (ii) any Team found to have
committed such a violation for the second time shall be jointly and severally liable for three (3)
times the amount of compensatory damages.
(c) Three (3) times the amount of compensatory damages, plus, for each
Team found to have violated Section 1 above for at least the third time, five hundred thousand
dollars (\$500,000), in the event that any of the Teams found to have violated Section 1 above
have committed such violation for at least the third time. In the event that damages are awarded
pursuant to this subsection (c): (i) any Team found to have committed such a violation for the
first time shall be jointly and severally liable for two (2) times the amount of compensatory
damages; (ii) any Team found to have committed such a violation for at least the second time
shall be jointly and severally liable for three (3) times the amount of compensatory damages; and
(iii) any Team found to have committed such a violation for at least the third time shall, in
addition, pay a fine of five hundred thousand dollars (\$500,000).
Section 10. Payment of Damages.
In the event damages are awarded pursuant to Section 9 above, the amount of
compensatory damages shall be paid to the injured player or players. The amount of non-
compensatory damages, including any fines, shall be paid to the Players Association, which may
use it for any purpose other than to pay it to any player who has received compensatory damages,
except that any such player may receive some portion of a non-compensatory damage award as
part of a proportional distribution to Players Association members.
Section 11. Effect of Damages on Salary Cap.
In the event damages are awarded pursuant to Section 9 above, the amount of
non-compensatory damages, including any fines, will not be included in any of the computations
described in Article VII of this Agreement. The amount of compensatory damages awarded will
be included in such computations.
Section 12. Contribution.
Any Team found liable under Section 1 above shall have the right to seek
contribution from any other Team found liable for the same violation in a proceeding before the
Commissioner who shall determine what contribution, if any, is fair and equitable. The
Commissioner's determination with regard to contribution shall be final and binding upon and
unappealable by any Team. A contribution determination by the Commissioner may be appealed
by the Players Association to the Arbitrator, except that if such a determination involves fewer
than four (4) Teams found to have committed a violation of Section 1 above and allocates
damages equally among the Teams found liable, there shall be no appeal to the Arbitrator. In the
event of a contribution determination by the Commissioner, the WNBA shall provide the Players
Association with the data and information that the Commissioner used or relied upon in making
her determination. Any contribution determination appealed by the Players Association to the
Arbitrator shall be upheld unless it is clearly erroneous.
Section 13. No Reimbursement.
Any damages awarded pursuant to Section 9 above must be paid by the individual
Teams found liable and those Teams may not be reimbursed or indemnified by any other Team
or the WNBA, except to the extent of any award of contribution made pursuant to Section 12
above.
Section 14. Costs.
In any action brought for an alleged violation of Section 1 above, the Arbitrator
shall order the payment of reasonable attorneys' fees by any party found to have brought such an
action or to have asserted a defense to such an action without any reasonable basis for asserting
such a claim or defense.
Section 15. Termination of Agreement.
(a) The Players Association shall have the right to terminate this Agreement
under the following circumstances:
Where there has been a finding or findings of one (1) or more
instances of a violation of Section 1 above with respect to any one WNBA Season which, either
individually or in total, involved four (4) or more Teams and caused injury to four (4) or more
players; or
Where there has been a finding or findings of one (1) or more
instances of a violation of Section 1 above with respect to any two (2) consecutive WNBA
Seasons which, either individually or in total, involved five (5) or more Teams and caused
economic injury to five (5) or more players. For purposes of this Section 15(a)(ii), a player found
to have been injured by a violation of Section 1 above in each of two (2) consecutive Seasons
shall be counted as an additional player injured by such a violation for each such WNBA Season;
or
Where, in a proceeding brought by the Players Association, it is
shown by clear and convincing evidence that six (6) or more Teams have engaged in a violation
or violations of Section 1 above, causing economic injury to one or more WNBA players. In
order to terminate this Agreement pursuant to this subsection (a)(iii) and subsection (b) below:
the proceeding must be brought by the Players Association;
and
the WNBA and the Arbitrator must be informed at the
outset of any such proceeding that the Players Association is proceeding under this subsection
(a)(iii) for the purpose of establishing its entitlement to terminate this Agreement.
(b) To execute a termination, pursuant to this Section 15, the Players
Association must serve upon the WNBA written notice of termination within thirty (30) days
after the Arbitrator's report finding the requisite conditions becomes final. In the absence of an
Arbitrator, the Players Association shall have the option to execute such a termination by serving
upon the WNBA written notice of such termination within thirty (30) days after any decision by
a court finding the requisite conditions. In the latter situation, if the finding of the court is
reversed on appeal, the Agreement shall be immediately reinstated and both parties reserve their
rights with respect to any conduct by the other party during the period from the date of service of
the termination notice to the date upon which the Agreement was reinstated. If the Players
Association exercises the right accorded it by this Section 15, this Agreement shall terminate
immediately following the service of the termination notice, unless the service of the termination
notice occurs during the period February 1 through October 29, in which case this Agreement
shall terminate on the immediately following October 30.
Section 16. Discovery.
(a) In any of the actions described in this Article XVI, the Arbitrator shall
grant reasonable and expedited discovery upon the application of any party where, and to the
extent, he or she determines it is reasonable to do so. Such discovery may include the production
of documents and the taking of depositions.
(b) Notwithstanding Section 16(a) above, the Players Association and the
WNBA shall each have the right to obtain discovery upon request in any three (3) proceedings
brought under this Article XVI during the term of this Agreement. The scope and extent of such
discovery shall be determined by the Arbitrator.
Section 17. Time Limits.
Any action under Section 1 above must be brought within 90 days of the time
when the player or the Players Association knows or reasonably should have known that she had
a claim, or within 90 days of the start of the WNBA Season in which a violation of Section 1
above is claimed, whichever is later. In the absence of an Arbitrator, the complaining party shall
file such claim for breach of this Agreement pursuant to Section 301 of the Labor Management
Relations Act in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York. Any party
alleged to have violated Section 1 shall have the right, prior to any proceedings on the merits, to
make an initial motion to dismiss any complaint that does not comply with the timeliness
requirement of this Section 17.
