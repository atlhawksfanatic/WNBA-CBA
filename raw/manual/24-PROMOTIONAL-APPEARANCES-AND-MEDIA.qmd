PROMOTIONAL APPEARANCES AND MEDIA
Section 1. General.
(a) In addition to the appearances required under Article XXVI of this
Agreement, a player may be required to make a reasonable number of promotional appearances
on behalf of the Team or the WNBA during any Season and immediately succeeding Off-
Season. These promotional appearances, as to which the player will be given reasonable
advance notice, may include, but shall not be limited to, youth organization visits, award shows,
public service or charitable events, clinics, autograph signing sessions, or hospitality or
promotional events involving or relating to WNBA Competitions. No such promotional
appearance shall be made on behalf of a commercial sponsor; nor shall such appearance require a
player to endorse or give a testimonial for any product or service. Any such promotional
appearances during the Off-Season will be scheduled at times and locations agreeable to the
player and the Team or the WNBA. A Team or WNBA representative shall be present for the
duration of all appearances required under this Article XXIV and Article XXVI of this
Agreement to monitor such appearances. Players will be reimbursed for out-of-pocket expenses
actually incurred in connection with required appearances, provided such expenses are
documented to the Team or the WNBA, result directly from the appearances and are ordinary
and reasonable.
(b) A player shall not be compensated for any of the first ten (10) promotional
appearances made by such player on behalf of a Team during any Season and the immediately
succeeding Off-Season. Beginning with the eleventh (11th) such appearance, the player shall be

appearance beginning with appearance number twelve (12)).
(c) No player may be paid more than \$3,000 by a Team during any Season
and immediately succeeding Off-Season for promotional appearances made pursuant to this
Article XXIV (i.e., no player may be required to make more than twenty (20) appearances during
any Season and immediately succeeding Off-Season pursuant to this Article XXIV if the player
has not been assessed any Additional Unpaid Team Promotional Appearances).
(d) The following guidelines shall apply to appearances required under this
Article XXIV and Article XXVI of this Agreement:
The players understand the importance of player accessibility to
the business of the league and will continue to enthusiastically participate in the various
marketing programs of the league and Teams. The league and Teams understand that it is
important to prioritize the use of players off the court and to maximize the efficiency of player
appearances (by, for instance, scheduling appearances to last an appropriate amount of time
based on the circumstances, including the nature of the appearance).
Each player shall be afforded at least two (2) days during each
month occurring during a Season (excluding any month that has fewer than twenty (20) days of
the Season in such month) in which the player will not be required by a Team to make any
appearances required under this Article XXIV or Article XXVI of this Agreement.

provided, however, that any appearance by a player in connection with the WNBA All-Star
Game or the NBA All-Star Game or activities related to such games shall not count as an
appearance for purposes of this subsection (d)(iii);
No player shall be required to make both a pre-game and post-
game appearance on the same day on more than six (6) days during any Season; and
No player may be asked by a Team to do more than ten (10)
promotional appearances during any Season and succeeding Off-Season unless four (4) other
players on such Team have been asked to do at least three (3) promotional appearances during
such Season and succeeding Off-Season.
The player shall be given written notice (including via electronic
means) as to whether an appearance is promotional or commercial.
(e) A player shall not be compensated for any of the first three (3)
promotional appearances made by such player on behalf of the WNBA during any Season and
the immediately succeeding Off-Season. Beginning with the fourth (4th) such promotional
appearance the player shall be paid \$750.00 for every other such appearance (i.e. the player shall
be paid for appearance number four (4), six (6), eight (8), etc.).
(f) The foregoing provisions shall not apply to: (i) any appearance in
connection with a game that is scheduled to take place within two hours before or two hours after
such game (e.g., pre- and post-game autograph sessions) (the "Window"), but shall apply to any
appearance scheduled to take place outside of the Window; (ii) any appearance by a Rookie in
connection with any WNBA Draft; (iii) any appearance by a player at an award presentation

(g) Players shall cooperate with all reasonable requests of the news media.
Such cooperation by players shall include, but not be limited to, making themselves available for
interviews conducted at reasonable times, including interviews before, during, or after WNBA
Competitions (whether in specially designed interview rooms, interview areas or elsewhere), and
for interviews conducted during off-days or during the Off-Season. Any such interviews during
the Off-Season will be scheduled at times and locations agreeable to the player and the WNBA.
Section 2. Liaisons.
The WNBA, on the one hand, and the Players Association, on the other hand,
shall each appoint, from its employees, a representative to serve as a primary contact (a
"Liaison") regarding player appearances. Through the Liaisons, the parties shall conduct
meetings (in person or telephonically) monthly during the Season, or at such other intervals as
the parties may agree, to discuss any issues that arise relating to player appearances. The
meetings may be attended by staff members and advisors of the WNBA and the Players
Association.
