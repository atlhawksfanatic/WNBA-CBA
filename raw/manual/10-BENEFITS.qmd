BENEFITS
Section 1. Health Insurance.
(a) Medical Coverage.
During each Season covered by this Agreement, each player who is a party to a
Standard Player Contract (and such player's eligible dependents, if applicable) will be provided
with medical benefits for the period beginning on the first day of training camp and ending on
the day such Contract expires or is terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the medical
benefits for a player waived during the Regular Season shall not be terminated until seven (7)
days after such Contract is terminated. The eligibility requirements, circumstances under which
benefits may be terminated, and the nature of the benefits will be set forth in summaries that will
be distributed by the WNBA to each player signed to a Contract and to the Players Association.
For the 2019 Season, subject to any conditions and limitations
contained in the plan, the medical plan provided that players received both (A) in-network
services with a copayment for certain services, a \$600 annual deductible per covered individual
(\$1,800 per family), and coverage at eighty percent (80%) until the covered individual has paid
\$3,000 per person (\$9,000 per family) in a calendar year, and one hundred percent (100%)
thereafter, with no annual lifetime maximum benefit; and (B) out-of-network services with a
\$3,000 annual deductible per covered individual (\$9,000 per family), coverage for sixty percent
(60%) for most eligible charges (as set forth in the plan) and seventy percent (70%) for certain
other eligible charges (as set forth in the plan) until the covered individual has paid \$9,000 per
person (\$27,000 per family) in a calendar year, and one-hundred percent (100%) thereafter, with
no annual or lifetime maximum benefit. A player who elected coverage for her dependents,
under the medical plan, paid thirty-three percent (33%) of the cost of such coverage.
89players will receive the medical benefits described in Section 1(a)(i) above, provided that the
premiums (which, for purposes of this Section 1(a)(ii), shall include any excise tax payable by
the WNBA) for such benefits do not exceed by more than 5% the premiums paid by the WNBA
for medical insurance coverage for players with respect to the immediately preceding Season. If
the premiums for such benefits increase in any Season by less than 5%, then the difference
between 5% and the actual amount of any such increase shall be carried forward and used to
fund any increase in premiums in one or more future Seasons of more than 5%, provided that
under no circumstance shall (x) the WNBA pay premiums for any Season that exceed the
immediately preceding Season's premiums by more than 10%, or (y) the WNBA be obligated to
pay to the players, in benefits or otherwise, any carry-forward that is not used to fund the
premiums for the benefits specified in this Section 1(a)(ii). If the premiums for the medical
insurance coverage exceed the limitations set by this Section 1(a)(ii) in any Season, the WNBA
(after consultation with the WNBPA) shall make changes in the benefits so that such premium
limitations are not exceeded.
(b) Dental Coverage.
During each Season covered by this Agreement, each player who is a party to a
Standard Player Contract (and such player's eligible dependents, if applicable) will be provided
with dental benefits for the period beginning on the first day of training camp and ending on the
day such Contract expires or is terminated. The eligibility requirements, circumstances under
which benefits may be terminated, and the nature of the benefits will be set forth in summaries
that will be distributed by the WNBA to each player signed to a Contract and to the Players
Association.
90contained in the plan, the dental plan provided two options, the DHMO plan or the DPPO plan.
The DPPO plan provided the following benefits: in-network and out-of-network services: for
preventative services (as defined in the insurance plan), no annual deductible and coverage for
seventy-five percent (75%); for basic and major services, an annual deductible of \$75 per person
(\$225 per family) and coverage for eighty percent (80%) of basic services (as those services are
defined in the insurance plan) and fifty percent (50%) of major services (as those services are
defined in the insurance plan), with an annual maximum of \$1,000 per person. The DHMO plan
provided the following benefits: no annual deductible and no lifetime maximum under both the
DPPO plan and the DHMO plan, the players pay a copayment based on the service provided (as
defined in the insurance plan); and, if the player elected coverage for her dependents, the player
paid for thirty-three percent (33%) of the cost of such coverage.
For each Season hereunder, beginning with the 2020 Season,
players will receive the dental benefits described in Section 1(b)(i) above provided that the
premiums for such benefits do not exceed by more than 5% the premiums paid by the WNBA for
dental insurance coverage for players with respect to the immediately preceding Season. If the
premiums for the dental insurance coverage exceed the limitations set by this Section 1(b)(ii) in
any Season, the WNBA (after consultation with the WNBPA) shall make changes in the benefits
so that such premium limitations are not exceeded.
Section 2. Pregnancy Disability Benefit.
(a) A player who cannot render the services required under her Standard
Player Contract as a result of her pregnancy shall receive one hundred percent (100%) of the
Base Salary that she would have received under Exhibit 1 to her Standard Player Contract had
91Player Contract if her Contract is traded while she cannot render the playing services required
under her Contract, but shall not be eligible for any Team merit bonuses (as set forth in Article
IX) unless she was able to perform services in at least one Regular Season game during the
applicable Season. The player shall receive the Base Salary described in the preceding sentence
in accordance with the payment schedule contained in her Standard Player Contract for the
shorter of: (i) the duration of her inability to perform services as a result of her pregnancy; or (ii)
the remaining term of her Standard Player Contract.
(b) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2(a) above, a player whose
Standard Player Contract is terminated while she is pregnant shall, if the applicable insurance
policies allow, continue to receive the medical benefits provided for by Section 1(a) until the
later of the end of the Season in which such Contract was terminated or three months after the
birth of her child. If coverage under the applicable insurance policies cannot be continued, and if
the player elects continued coverage pursuant to COBRA, the WNBA shall pay the premiums for
such coverage for the player until the later of the end of the Season in which her Contract was
terminated or three months after the birth of her child.
Section 3. 401(k) Program.
(a) The WNBA shall cause to be maintained for each Season during the term
of this Agreement, a multi-employer profit sharing plan (the "Retirement and 401(k) Savings
Plan") qualified under Section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the
"Internal Revenue Code"). During each Season covered by this Agreement, the Retirement and
401(k) Savings Plan will:
92Salary not in excess of the legal limit set forth in Section 402(g) of the Internal Revenue Code
("401(k) Deferrals");
provide for employer matching contributions equal to twenty-five
percent (25%) of the 401(k) Deferrals contributed to the Retirement and 401(k) Savings Plan by
each player during that Season ("Matching Contributions"); and
provide for employer contributions for each Season on behalf of
each eligible player for such Season ("Regular Contributions") equal to an amount to be
determined as follows:
players with two years of WNBA playing service as of the
end of that Season — two percent (2%) of the player's Base Salary for that Season;
players with three years of WNBA playing service as of the
end of that Season — three percent (3%) of the player's Base Salary for that Season; and
players with four years or more of WNBA playing service
as of the end of that Season — four percent (4%) of the player's Base Salary for that Season.
(b) For purposes of subsection (a) above:
the Base Salary of a player shall be as set forth in Exhibit 1 to her
Contract;
a player shall be credited with a year of WNBA playing service if
the player was on the Regular Season roster of any WNBA Team(s) for fifty percent (50%) or
more of the total Regular Season games of the applicable Season; and
a player shall be an eligible player for a Season if that player is
credited with a year of WNBA playing service for that Season.
93shall be subject to all applicable limitations under the Internal Revenue Code.
(d) The total amount of 401(k) Deferrals, Matching Contributions and Regular
Contributions shall be limited to an amount that will result in all of such deferrals and
contributions being fully deductible under the Internal Revenue Code for the year in which
contributed to the Retirement and 401(k) Savings Plan.
(e) In the event that the players are not, or cease to be considered, collectively
bargained employees under the Internal Revenue Code, the Employee Retirement Income
Security Act of 1974, as amended ("ERISA"), or the regulations under either, with respect to the
Retirement and 401(k) Savings Plan, then any obligation to maintain and/or make contributions
to the Retirement and 401(k) Savings Plan pursuant to this Agreement shall terminate; provided,
however, that any such termination shall not impair the legally binding effect (if any) of any
other provision of this Agreement. In the event such termination results from any change or
amendment made to the Internal Revenue Code or ERISA or from any regulation (whether final
or temporary) or ruling issued thereunder (or from any judicial or administrative interpretation or
enforcement of any of the foregoing), an alternative benefit or compensation arrangement,
acceptable to both the WNBA and the Players Association, shall be established in lieu of the
Retirement and 401(k) Savings Plan. The cost of such alternative benefit or compensation
arrangement (excluding initial plan design and implementation costs) shall not exceed the annual
cost that the WNBA would have incurred under the Retirement and 401(k) Savings Plan had it
continued to be maintained.
94The WNBA shall continue to maintain in effect a group life insurance policy
providing a face policy amount of \$100,000 per player. In the event that the policy permits an
individual player to increase the face value with respect to such player by paying additional
funds directly to the carrier without additional expense to the WNBA, nothing herein shall
preclude such increase.
Section 5. Player Programs.
The WNBA shall continue to administer Off-Season player programs that may
include tuition reimbursement for undergraduate education (with respect to players who did not
complete such education prior to joining the WNBA), graduate school or vocational/trade school,
a pre-professional certification program, a career apprenticeship program, a substance abuse
education program, and/or a program to educate players with regard to individual financial
management. The WNBA agrees to contribute an aggregate sum of not less than \$75,000 per
year toward such programs. The allocation of such sum among the programs, and the type and
content of, and participants in, such programs, shall be determined each year in consultation with
the Players Association.
Section 6. Administration of Plans.
All decisions with respect to the design, implementation, and administration of
the plans and programs set forth in this Article, including the selection of insurance carriers and
the investment options to be available under the Retirement and 401(k) Savings Plan, will be
made by the WNBA. The Players Association waives any right to participate in the design,
implementation, and administration of the plans and programs, including the selection from time
to time of new insurance carriers and the investment options to be available under the Retirement
95Players Association prior to any substantial changes (e.g., a new carrier), and the Players
Association reserves the right to grieve under the procedures set forth in Article XXII any
alleged failure by the WNBA to provide the benefits that it has agreed to provide under this
Article.
Section 7. Childcare Assistance Program.
Subject to the requirements of Section 129 of the Internal Revenue Code, each
Team will reimburse on a tax-preferred basis eligible childcare expenses as-incurred of up to
\$750 per calendar month during which one or more Regular Season games are played (capped at
the Internal Revenue Code maximum of \$5,000 per year) per player with one or more dependent
children who are under age thirteen (13) and who, during the Season, are living with such player
either full-time or for a significant amount of time (e.g., not solely visitation) pursuant to a
custody arrangement (court-ordered or otherwise).
Section 8. Family Planning.
For each Season hereunder, beginning with the 2020 Season (with
reimbursements to be provided in the 2020 Season as soon as administratively practicable), the
Teams shall reimburse any player with eight (8) or more Years of Service up to \$20,000 for costs
directly related to adoption, surrogacy, oocyte cryopreservation, or fertility or infertility
treatment, provided that the foregoing services are not services covered by the health insurance
offered pursuant to Section 1 above. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall (a) the
total benefit received by any player during her WNBA career pursuant to the preceding sentence
exceed \$60,000 or (b) the aggregate amount paid by all Teams (or the League, as the case may
be) in any Season pursuant to the preceding sentence exceed \$150,000.
96Upon player request, each Team shall identify and make available
(a) accommodations for nursing mothers that provide a comfortable, safe, private place (other
than a bathroom) that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from other players, staff and
the public and (b) access to refrigeration for breastmilk.
