PLAYER CONDUCT AND DISCIPLINE
Section 1. Player Obligations.
Players shall at all times conform their conduct to standards of good citizenship,
good moral character, and good sportsmanship and shall not do anything detrimental or
prejudicial to the best interests of the WNBA, their Teams, or the sport of basketball. Without
limiting the foregoing, players shall also be required at all times to comply with all terms and
provisions of this Agreement; to perform all services required under their Standard Player
Contracts or any WNBA or Team Marketing and Promotional Agreements; to comply at all
times with all applicable federal, state, and local laws; to be neatly attired and present a
professional appearance when in public (including all player appearances, travel days, and travel
to and from the arena); and to follow all reasonable rules and regulations of the WNBA and their
Teams promulgated in accordance with this Agreement.
Section 2. Player Discipline.
(a) In addition to any other rights it has under this Agreement and the
Standard Player Contract, the WNBA and/or a Team may impose reasonable discipline on a
player for any act or omission that fails to conform to the requirements set forth in Section 1
above. Such discipline may include reasonable fines and/or suspensions.
(b) The WNBA and the Team shall not discipline a player for the same act or
conduct. The WNBA's disciplinary action will preclude or supersede disciplinary action by any
Team for the same act or conduct, except the same act or conduct by a player may result in both
a termination of the player's Standard Player Contract by her Team and the suspension of the
player by the WNBA if the egregious nature of the act or conduct is so lacking in justification as
to warrant such double penalty.
120All fines shall be deducted from a player's paycheck for the pay period
immediately following the imposition of such fines or as promptly thereafter as is reasonably
possible. When a player is suspended: (i) for a predetermined number of games or for any period
of time during the playoffs, her full Base Salary for the Season in which such suspension occurs
shall be reduced by an amount equal to her full Base Salary multiplied by a fraction, the
numerator of which shall be the number of pre-season, Regular Season, and/or playoff games
missed as a consequence of the suspension, and the denominator of which shall be the number of
pre-season and Regular Season games in such Season; (ii) for a duration of days or an
indeterminate duration not including any period of time during the playoffs, her full base salary
for the Season in which such suspension occurs shall be reduced by an amount equal to her full
Base Salary multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the number of Regular
Season days missed as a consequence of the suspension, and the denominator of which shall be
the total number of days in such Regular Season; provided, however, that the foregoing
calculation shall not result in the reduction of a player's Base Salary in an amount greater than
such Base Salary. If, at the time the player is fined or suspended, the amount remaining to be
earned under her Standard Player Contract is not sufficient to cover such fine or suspension
amount, the player shall promptly pay such amount directly to the WNBA.
Section 4. Charitable Contributions.
(a) In the event that (i) a fine or suspension is imposed on a player, (ii) such
fine or suspension related Compensation amount is collected by the League, and (iii) the fine or
suspension is not grieved pursuant to Article XXII, then the WNBA shall remit fifty percent
(50%) of the amount collected to a charitable organization selected by the Players Association
121now in effect or as it may hereafter be amended (a "Section 501(c)(3) Organization"), and that is
approved by the WNBA (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld) (both hereinafter,
the "WNBPA Selected Charitable Organization"). The WNBA shall remit the remaining fifty
percent (50%) of the amount collected to a Section 501(c)(3) organization selected by the
WNBA and approved by the Players Association, which approval shall not be unreasonably
withheld.
(b) The remittances made by the WNBA pursuant to this Section 4 shall be
made annually, thirty (30) days following the end of the WNBA Season during which the fine or
suspension related Compensation amount is collected by the WNBA. For purposes of this
Article and all other provisions of this Agreement, any money remitted or paid to a charity or
foundation controlled by or affiliated with the WNBPA shall be used for charitable purposes
only, and not, for example, for any salaries of the organization's employees or administrative
expenses.
(c) If a timely Grievance is filed under Article XXII challenging a fine or
suspension of the kind designated in Section 4(a) above, and, following the disposition of the
Grievance, the Arbitrator determines that all or part of the fine or suspension-related amount
(plus any accrued interest thereon) is payable by the player to the WNBA, then the WNBA shall
remit the amount collected by it (plus any interest) in accordance with the provisions of Sections
4(a) and (b) above.
Section 5. Gambling.
(a) The Commissioner, in her sole discretion, shall direct the dismissal and
disqualification from any further association with the WNBA of any player found by the
122attempting to cause any WNBA Competition to result otherwise than on its merits.
(b) Each WNBA player shall be required to disclose to a WNBA or Team
official any attempt by any person to give or receive money or anything of value to fix, throw or
otherwise affect the outcome, score or any other aspect of any WNBA Competition other than on
its merits. Any player found by the Commissioner after a hearing to have violated this provision
shall, in the sole discretion of the Commissioner, be subject to a reasonable fine or a suspension
not to exceed ten (10) games.
(c) Any player found by the Commissioner after a hearing to have been guilty
of wagering (directly or indirectly), or of offering or attempting to wager, money or anything of
value on the outcome, score, or any other aspect of any WNBA Competition shall, in the sole
discretion of the Commissioner, be subject to a fine, suspension, and/or dismissal and
disqualification from any further association with the WNBA.
Section 6. Holdouts.
In addition to any fine or suspension that a Team may impose on a player for
failing to report at the start of the Season at the time and place designated by the Team, a Team
may suspend such player for the remainder of such Season if: (a) she notifies the Team in writing
that she will not be playing in the WNBA during such Season (it being understood that a player
providing any such notification to a team shall not be construed to have consented to any fine
imposed on the player for her failure to report); (b) within fourteen (14) days after the start of the
Season, she fails either to report to the Team or to provide written notice to the Team stating that
she intends to report within twenty-one (21) days after the start of such Season; or (c) she fails to
report to the Team within twenty-one (21) days after the start of such Season. In any challenge
123shall be whether, in fact, the player failed to report or provide the requisite written notice, and
neither the player nor the Players Association may otherwise contend that there was not just
cause for the discipline imposed.
Section 7. Fines for Missing Games.
The Team or, if the Team declines, the WNBA may fine any player who misses
Regular Season or playoff games due to basketball-related commitments with another league or
entity as follows: up to two and one half percent (2 ½%) of the player's Base Salary for each
Regular Season game missed and up to five percent (5%) of a player's Base Salary for each
playoff game missed. In no event may the aggregate fines imposed on a player by the WNBA or
a Team pursuant to this Section 7 exceed (i) twenty percent (20%) of the player's Base Salary for
missing Regular Season games in any Season, and (ii) twenty-five percent (25%) of a player's
Base Salary for missing playoff games in any Season. For clarity, (i) if the WNBA or a Team
imposes a fine pursuant to this Section 7 in respect of missed Regular Season or playoff games,
neither the Team nor the WNBA, as the case may be, shall be permitted to impose an additional
fine on the player for the same missed games, and (ii) nothing in this Section 7 shall be construed
to limit a Team's right, in circumstances where the WNBA or a Team has imposed 2 ½% or 5%
fines in respect of missed games, to impose a suspension or other discipline on a player for the
same (or other) missed games in accordance with this Agreement (and the 20% and 25% caps
noted above shall not be applicable to any lost salary due to any such suspension).
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 7, the additional fines for missing
Regular Season or playoff games contained in this Section 7 shall not result in a reduction of a
player's Base Salary in an amount greater than such Base Salary.
124In addition to (i) any fine, suspension or other discipline that a Team may impose
on a player for failing to report at the start of the Season at the time and place designated by the
Team in accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) any fine, suspension or other discipline that a
Team may impose on a player for missing any part of training camp in accordance with this
Agreement, the Team or, if the Team declines, the WNBA may require players to make
Additional Unpaid Team Promotional Appearances (as that term is defined in Article XXIV,
Section 1(b)) for missing any part of training camp due to basketball-related commitments with
another league or entity as follows: if the player misses all or any part of the first seven (7) days
of training camp, one Additional Unpaid Team Promotional Appearance; if the player misses all
or any part of the second seven (7) days of training camp, one Additional Unpaid Team
Promotional Appearance; and, if the player misses all or any part of the remainder of training
camp, one Additional Unpaid Team Promotional Appearance.
Section 9. WNBA Prioritization.
(a) Start of Season Requirements (2023 Season).
In addition to any fine or suspension that a Team may impose on a
player for failing to report at the start of any Season at the time and place designated by the
Team in accordance with this Agreement and subject to subsection (d) below, with respect to the
2023 Season, the WNBA shall (i) fine any player under Contract for the Season as of the day
prior to the start of the Season (a "Pre-Training Camp Contracted Player") who does not report at
the time and place designated by the Team by the start of the 2023 Season one percent (1%) of
the player's Base Salary for each missed training camp day ("Missed Training Camp Day"); and
(ii) suspend without pay for the entire remainder of the 2023 Season any Pre-Training Camp
125of the 2023 Regular Season or May 1, 2023, whichever is later.
Subject to subsection (d) below, with respect to the 2023 Season,
the WNBA shall (i) fine any player who is not a Pre-Training Camp Contracted Player, who
subsequently signs a Player Contract during training camp (a "Training Camp Contracted
Player") and who had not fully completed any Off-Season Playing Obligation prior to the start of
the 2023 Season, one percent (1%) of such Training Camp Contracted Player's Base Salary for
each Missed Training Camp Day and (ii) shall suspend without pay for the entire remainder of
the 2023 Season any Training Camp Contracted Player who does not report at the time and place
designated by the Team by the start of the 2023 Regular Season or May 1, 2023, whichever is
later. For purposes of the foregoing clause (i), such Training Camp Contracted Player's Missed
Training Camp Days shall accrue from the start of the 2023 Season and accordingly shall include
any days during which such player was not under Contract.
Subject to subsection (d) below, any player who (i) is not a Pre–
Training Camp Contracted Player, (ii) does not become a Training Camp Contracted Player and
(iii) does not fully complete any Off-Season Playing Obligation prior to the start of the 2023
Regular Season or May 1, 2023, whichever is later, shall not be eligible to sign a Player Contract
covering all, or any part, of the 2023 Season.
(b) Start of Season Requirements (2024-2027 Seasons).
In addition to any fine or suspension that a Team may impose on a
player for failing to report at the start of any Season at the time and place designated by the
Team in accordance with this Agreement and subject to subsection (d) below, with respect to any
Season hereunder after the 2023 Season, the WNBA shall suspend without pay for the entire
126time and place designated by the Team by the start of such Season or May 1 of such Season,
whichever is later.
Subject to subsection (d) below, with respect to any Season
hereunder after the 2023 Season, any player who is not a Pre-Training Camp Contracted Player
and who does not fully complete any Off-Season Playing Obligation prior to the start of any such
Season shall not be eligible to sign a Player Contract covering all, or any part, of such Season.
(c) In-Season Departures (2023-2027 Seasons). In addition to any penalties
to which a player may be subject pursuant to subsections (a) and (b) above, any player who is
under Contract for any Season hereunder who reports to her Team for a Season and then leaves
the Team at any point during such Season (hereafter for purposes of this subsection (c), "Season
One") (i) to provide basketball-related services for any entity other than the WNBA for any
reason, or (ii) for any personal reason, other than, with respect to each of clauses (i) and (ii), for
the reasons set forth in subsection (d) below, shall be suspended without pay for the remainder of
Season One and shall be ineligible to play in the WNBA during the Season following Season
One (hereafter for purposes of this subsection (c), "Season Two") (i.e., suspended for Season
Two if she is under Contract for Season Two at the time of the Season One suspension or
ineligible to sign a Player Contract for all, or any part, of Season Two if she is not under
Contract for Season Two at the time of the Season One suspension).
(d) Exceptions to WNBA Prioritization. The WNBA prioritization rules
contained in this Section 9 shall not apply (i) to players with zero (0), one (1) or two (2) Years of
Service as of the end of the preceding Season, or (ii) to the extent that players report late to their
Team for the start of a Season, or leave their Team during a Season, to participate with their
127World Cup or a FIBA continental championship (e.g., the European Championship), provided
that any such player returns to her Team within forty-eight (48) hours after her national team has
completed play in such FIBA competition. In addition, if a player is late for, or leaves during,
the Season due to a significant life event wholly unrelated to an Off-Season Playing Obligation
(e.g., a graduation ceremony or a death in the family), the prioritization rules contained in this
Section 9 shall not apply, provided that the player makes good-faith attempts to provide advance
notice to her Team and reports, or returns to, the Team within twenty-four (24) hours after the
conclusion of her commitments related to the significant life event.
(e) The unearned Base Salary for any player suspended pursuant to this
Section 9 shall be promptly removed from the Team's Team Salary.
Section 10. Unlawful Violence.
When a player is convicted of (including a plea of guilty, no contest, or nolo
contendere to) a violent felony, she shall immediately be suspended by the WNBA for a
minimum of five (5) games.
Section 11. Counseling for Violent Misconduct.
(a) In addition to any other rights a Team or the WNBA may have by contract
or law, when the WNBA and the Players Association agree that there is reasonable cause to
believe that a player has engaged in any type of off-court violent conduct, the player will (if the
WNBA and the Players Association so agree) be required to undergo a clinical evaluation by a
neutral expert and, if deemed necessary by such expert, appropriate counseling, with such
evaluation and counseling program to be developed and supervised by the WNBA and the
Players Association, unless the player has engaged in acts covered by the Joint WNBA/WNBPA
128the terms of that Policy shall apply. For purposes of this paragraph, "violent conduct" shall
include, but not be limited to, any conduct involving the use or threat of physical violence or the
use of, or threat to use, a deadly weapon, any conduct which could be categorized as a "hate
crime," and any conduct involving dog fighting or animal cruelty.
(b) Any player who is convicted of (including a plea of guilty, no contest, or
nolo contendere to) a crime involving violent conduct shall be required to attend at least five (5)
counseling sessions with a therapist or counselor jointly selected by the WNBA and the Players
Association, unless the player has engaged in acts covered by the Joint WNBA/WNBPA Policy
on Domestic/Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual Assault, and Child Abuse, in which case the
terms of that Policy shall apply. These sessions shall be in addition to any discipline imposed on
the player by the WNBA for the conduct underlying her conviction. The therapist or counselor
who is jointly selected by the WNBA and the Players Association shall determine the total
number of counseling sessions to be attended by the player; provided that in no event shall a
player be required to attend more than ten (10) sessions; provided, further, that the number of
such sessions shall be reduced by the number of any counseling sessions that a player is ordered
by a court to attend and does subsequently attend, even if, notwithstanding the above, such
reduction results in the player attending fewer than five (5) counseling sessions with a therapist
or counselor jointly selected by the WNBA and the Players Association.
(c) Any player who, after being notified in writing by the WNBA that she is
required to undergo the clinical evaluation and/or counseling program authorized by Section
11(a) or 11(b) above, refuses or fails, without a reasonable explanation, to attend or participate in
such evaluation and counseling program within seventy-two (72) hours following such notice,
129(72) hours that the player refuses or fails to participate in such program.
Section 12. Firearms and Other Weapons.
(a) Whenever a player is physically present at a facility or venue owned,
operated, or being used by a Team, the WNBA, or any League-related entity, and whenever a
player is traveling on any WNBA-related business, whether on behalf of the player's Team, the
WNBA, or any League-related entity, such player shall not possess a firearm of any kind or any
other deadly weapon. For purposes of the foregoing, "a facility or venue" includes, but is not
limited to: an arena; a practice facility; a Team or League office or facility; an All-Star or
WNBA playoff venue; and the site of a promotional or charitable appearance.
(b) At the commencement of each Season, and if the player owns or possesses
any firearm, the player will provide the Team with proof that the player possesses a license or
registration as required by law for any such firearm. Each player is also required to provide the
Team with proof of any modifications or additions made to this information during the Season.
(c) Any violation of Section 12(a) or Section 12(b) above shall be considered
conduct prejudicial to the WNBA under Article XIV, Section 1, and shall therefore subject the
player to discipline by the WNBA in accordance with such Article.
Section 13. League Investigations.
(a) Players are required to cooperate with investigations conducted by the
WNBA. Failure to so cooperate, in the absence of a player's reasonable apprehension of her
own criminal prosecution, will subject the player to reasonable fines and/or suspensions imposed
by the WNBA. Any investigations of alleged misconduct that is covered by the Joint
130Abuse shall be governed by the terms of that Policy.
(b) Except as set forth in Section 13(c) below, the WNBA shall provide the
Players Association with such advance notice as is reasonable in the circumstances of any
interview or meeting to be held (in person or by telephone) between a WNBA representative and
a player under investigation by the WNBA for alleged misconduct, and shall invite a
representative of the Players Association to participate or attend. The failure or inability of a
Players Association representative to participate in or attend the interview or meeting, however,
shall not prevent the interview or meeting from proceeding as scheduled. A willful disregard by
the WNBA of its obligation to notify the Players Association as provided for by this Section
13(b) shall bar the WNBA from using as evidence against the player in a proceeding involving
such alleged misconduct any statements made by the player in the interview or meeting
conducted by the WNBA representative.
(c) The provisions of Section 13(b) above shall not apply to interviews or
meetings: (i) held by the WNBA as part of an investigation with respect to alleged player
misconduct that occurred at the site of a game; and (ii) which take place during the course of, or
immediately preceding or following, such game. With respect to any such interview or meeting,
the WNBA's only obligation shall be to provide notice to the Players Association that the
WNBA will be conducting an investigation and holding an interview or meeting in connection
therewith. Such notice may be given by telephone at a telephone number or by email at an email
address to be designated in writing by the Players Association.
131At the commencement of each Season, and if the player owns or operates any
motor vehicle, the player will provide the Team with proof that the player possesses a valid
driver's license, registration documents, and insurance for any such vehicle. For players who
sign Standard Player Contracts during the Season, the player will provide the Team with such
information within fourteen (14) days following the execution of her Standard Player Contract.
Each player is also required to provide the Team with proof of any modifications or additions
made to this information during the Season.
Section 15. Player Convictions Involving Alcohol or Controlled Substances.
In addition to any other discipline imposed by the WNBA for such conduct, any
player who is convicted of (including a plea of guilty, no contest, or nolo contendere to) driving
while intoxicated, driving under the influence, driving under the influence of a controlled
substance (if that controlled substance is not a Prohibited Substance) or any similar crime shall
be required to submit to a mandatory evaluation by the Medical Director of the Anti-Drug
Program. After that mandatory evaluation, the Medical Director may require the player to attend
up to ten (10) substance abuse counseling sessions, provided that the number of such sessions
shall be reduced by the number of any substance abuse counseling sessions that a player is
ordered by a court to attend and does subsequently attend.
Section 16. Player Arrests.
A Team shall not impose discipline on a player solely on the basis of the fact that
the player has been arrested. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (a) a Team may impose discipline
on a player for the conduct underlying the player's arrest if it has an independent basis for doing
so, (b) nothing herein shall permit a Team to discipline a player for her failure to cooperate with
132criminal prosecution, and (c) nothing herein shall prevent a Team from precluding a player from
participating in Team activities without loss of pay to the extent it otherwise has the right to do
so.
Section 17. Joint WNBA/WNBPA Policy on Domestic/Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual
Assault, and Child Abuse.
The Joint WNBA/WNBPA Policy on Domestic/Intimate Partner Violence, Sexual
Assault, and Child Abuse is attached as Exhibit 9. Any evaluation, counseling, treatment, and/or
discipline of a player for engaging in acts covered by this Policy shall be governed by the terms
of the Policy.
133
