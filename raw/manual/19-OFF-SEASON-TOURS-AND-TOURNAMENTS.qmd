 ARTICLE XIX
OFF-SEASON TOURS AND TOURNAMENTS
Section 1. Participation and Compensation.
(a) The WNBA may, during the term of this Agreement, organize a Team or
Teams to participate in Off-Season games, tours or tournaments. A player shall be required to
participate in any such Off-Season games, tours or tournaments if she (x) is invited by the
WNBA to participate, and (y) does not have an Off-Season Playing Obligation that was
disclosed to the WNBA League Office in accordance with Article XVIII and that prevents her
from participating; provided, however, if such player is prevented from participating in such
games, tours or tournaments because of a family emergency or as a result of a bona fide
academic or occupational commitment, that, if missed, would materially impact the player's
post-WNBA career opportunities, such player will be excused from participation in such games,
tours or tournaments.
(b) Each player will receive the following as compensation for her
participation in any Off-Season games, tours or tournaments: \$4,000 for any games, tours or
tournaments that last one week, prorated as necessary to reflect any greater or lesser duration
(provided, however, if such games, tours or tournaments consist of only one game, such
compensation shall be \$1,500); the prior Season's meal expense allowance as set forth in Article
XI, Section 3; individual hotel rooms; and reimbursement for any round-trip transportation
expenses that she actually incurred for travel between her Off-Season residence and the location
of the Off-Season games, tours or tournaments (provided such expenses are documented to the
WNBA and were ordinary and reasonable).
Section 2. Non-WNBA Entities.
A player may not, without the consent of the WNBA, play in an all-star game,
tour, or tournament sponsored or operated by an entity other than the WNBA (other than a
tournament involving the player's national team or a team for which a player is playing pursuant
to an Off-Season Playing Obligation).
