(b) Neither the WNBA nor any Team may impose restrictions as to who may
visit players in the housing referred to in subsection (a) above. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
nothing herein shall excuse a player from complying with any reasonable training rules
promulgated by the WNBA or a Team or with any reasonable occupancy regulations established
by the owners or lessors (or their designees) of such housing. Any player who elects to stay in
housing provided by the Team may, upon reasonable advance notice and subject to availability,
elect to upgrade her unit to a larger unit, provided that such player shall pay to the Team the
difference between the cost of the Team-provided housing and the larger unit.
(c) Any player who, on or before the March 15 immediately preceding any
Season has entered into a Player Contract that is then in effect must notify the Team on or before
the immediately succeeding April 1 whether she elects Team-provided housing or a monthly
housing stipend (and, if she elects team-provided housing, whether such player has a child living
with her as described in subsection (a) above). All other players shall notify the Team of their
housing election within fourteen (14) days of their execution of a Player Contract (and, if she
elects team-provided housing, whether such player has a child living with her as described in
subsection (a) above). On or before the March 15 immediately preceding any Season, the
Players Association may notify the WNBA that it wishes to have one or more of its employees
conduct an inspection of any Team-provided housing, which inspection must be completed prior
to the immediately succeeding April 1 at a reasonable time mutually agreed between the Players
Association and the applicable WNBA Team. The parties agree to engage in reasonable
discussions with respect to any issues with such Team-provided housing that arise as a result of
such inspection.
(d) During training camp, players will be provided, in the sole discretion of
the Team, with either Team-provided housing, a monthly housing stipend (in the same amount as
set forth in subsection (a) above), or individual hotel rooms.
(e) When a Team is playing "on the road," players traveling with the Team
will be provided with individual hotel rooms in first-class hotel accommodations.
Section 2. Relocation Expenses.
(a) A player will receive a coach airline ticket from the city where she

play in the WNBA.
(b) A player who is assigned from one Team to another during the Season will
receive a coach airline ticket from her prior Team's city to the city of her new Team and will be
reimbursed for the actual and reasonable costs of shipping her personal belongings from her prior
Team's city to the city of her new Team. At the conclusion of such Season, the player will
receive a coach airline ticket from the city of her new Team to the city where she permanently
resides. For players who are assigned prior to the Mid-Point of the Regular Season only,
reimbursement may include up to one thousand dollars (\$1,000) for the shipment of one
automobile. No expenses incurred by a player shall be reimbursed pursuant to this Section 2(b)
unless they are pre-approved in writing by the Team.
(c) A player whose Contract is terminated will receive a coach airline ticket
back to the city where she permanently resides.
(d) Notwithstanding subsections (a), (b), and (c) above, where an assignment
or a Contract termination requires travel (from the city where a player permanently resides or a
prior Team's city, as the case may be) of less than 200 miles, no airline ticket will be provided.
Instead, the player's actual and reasonable ground travel expenses will be reimbursed provided
such expenses are documented to the appropriate Team.
(e) For purposes of subsections (a), (b), and (c) above, references to a coach
airline ticket shall mean, if available on the Team-chosen flights at the time of booking, a
premium economy (or similar enhanced coach fare).

(a) Players will be provided with a per day meal expense allowance while
playing for their Teams "on the road" and during the training camp period (but only if the Team
does not pay for meals directly), as follows.

Teams.

Team market: (i) provide use of one car for every two players; (ii) reimburse the player for the
cost of shipping a car into (and out of) the Team market up to a maximum per-Season
reimbursement of two thousand dollars (\$2,000) (prorated as necessary for players who arrive
more than two weeks into the Season or who sign rest-of-season contracts); (iii) reimburse the
player for the cost of renting a car for use in the Team market up to a maximum per-Season
reimbursement of two thousand dollars (\$2,000) (prorated as necessary to reflect the number of
days the player is on the active list); or (iv) reimburse players for miles driven (at the per-mile
rate contained within IRS guidelines) for players who have access to a car within five hundred
(500) miles of the Team market. A player may elect (iv) above in accordance with the preceding
sentence even if the car to which the player has access is more than five hundred (500) miles
from the Team market; provided, however, that in no event may the mileage reimbursement for
such player exceed two thousand dollars (\$2,000) (prorated as necessary to reflect the number of
days the player is on the active list). In the event that a player requests either (ii), (iii) or (iv)
above by written notice to her Team at least thirty (30) days prior to the start of training camp,
the Team will provide such reimbursement for such Season, provided, however, that if the car to
which the player has access is within five hundred (500) miles of the Team market, the player
may not elect (ii) above without the Team's consent.
(b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in subparagraph (a), during
training camp, players without a car in the Team market who are receiving reimbursement
pursuant to clauses (ii), (iii) or (iv) of subparagraph (a) shall be entitled to a maximum
reimbursement of two hundred and fifty dollars (\$250). In the event such player makes the
Regular Season roster, the player shall be entitled to receive the balance of the reimbursement
provided for in subparagraph (a) (i.e., up to \$1,750). In the event that the player does not make
the Regular Season roster, the Team shall have no further reimbursement obligation to the
player.
(c) In the event that an odd number of players are receiving either access to a
car or reimbursement for rental costs, the Team will provide the extra player with either access to
a car alone or reimbursement for a rental car up to a maximum of four thousand dollars (\$4,000),
prorated to reflect any partial Season during which there were an odd number of players
receiving reimbursement for rental costs. In the event that there are an odd number of players
receiving reimbursement for a rental car during training camp, such extra player shall be entitled
to a maximum reimbursement of five hundred dollars (\$500). In the event the extra player
makes the Regular Season roster, the extra player shall be entitled to receive the balance of the
reimbursement provided for in this subparagraph c (i.e., \$3,500).
(d) Players who enter into rest-of-season contracts after the ninetieth (90th)
day of the Regular Season and players who sign 7-day contracts shall be entitled to a maximum
reimbursement of one hundred dollars (\$100) for local transportation.
