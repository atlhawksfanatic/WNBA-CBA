\$1,463,200 \$1,507,100 \$1,552,300 \$1,598,800
(b) Guarantee Level. The level used to calculate (pursuant to (c) and (d)

(c) League-wide Guarantee.
As of the conclusion of each Season covered by this Agreement,
the WNBA agrees that Team Salaries for all Teams, in the aggregate, will not be less than an
amount equal to the sum of (i) the total number of WNBA Teams that played a full schedule of
Regular Season games during such Season, multiplied by the Guarantee Level for that Season,
and (ii) for each WNBA Team that played less than a full schedule of Regular Season games
during such Season, an amount equal to the Guarantee Level for that Season multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of Regular Season games played by the Team
during such Season and the denominator of which is the total number of Regular Season games
70"League-wide Guarantee"). For purposes of this Section 1(c), the Team Salaries for all Teams,
in the aggregate, as of the conclusion of a Season shall include any payments to players with
respect to such Season made by one or more Teams pursuant to Section 1(d) below.
In the event that, as of the conclusion of any Season, Team Salaries
for all Teams, in the aggregate, are less than the League-wide Guarantee for such Season (a
"Guarantee Shortfall"), the WNBA shall be obligated to pay the Guarantee Shortfall to all
WNBA players who were on a WNBA roster during the Regular Season covered by such Salary
Cap Year. Any such Guarantee Shortfall obligation shall be effectuated and satisfied solely by
the WNBA paying such Guarantee Shortfall to Teams no later than sixty (60) days following the
completion of the Season covered by such Salary Cap Year and causing the Teams to distribute
the Guarantee Shortfall to such players on such proportional basis as may be reasonably
determined by the Players Association, less all amounts required to be withheld by any
governmental authority. The Players Association shall provide the WNBA with its proposed
per-player distribution of any such Guarantee Shortfall for a Salary Cap Year within thirty (30)
days after the completion of the Season.
(d) Minimum Team Salary.
Beginning with the Salary Cap Year commencing on January 1,
2020, and for each Salary Cap Year thereafter during the term of this Agreement, there shall be a
Minimum Team Salary equal to 90% of the Guarantee Level.
In the event that, as of the conclusion of a Season, a Team's Team
Salary is less than the applicable Minimum Team Salary, the WNBA shall cause such Team to
make payments equal to the shortfall (to be disbursed to the players on such Team either in
71as may be reasonably determined by the Players Association). Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, any Team that ceases operations prior to the conclusion of a WNBA Season shall not
be required to meet the Minimum Team Salary obligation.

subsequently excluded from) a player's Salary. If any amounts paid to a player as described in
the preceding sentence relate to one or more future Salary Cap Years, such amounts will be
included in the corresponding Salary Cap Year(s). If any such amounts relate to the then-current

obligation for more than one (1) Season, they shall be included in Team Salary in equal amounts
over the same number of Salary Cap Years, with the first such Salary Cap Year being the Salary
Cap Year during which the Team's obligation to pay such amounts is determined, unless the
Team's obligation is determined during the period commencing on the day prior to the first day
of the Regular Season and continuing through the December 31 of any Salary Cap Year, in
which case the following Salary Cap Year shall be the first Salary Cap Year in which such

an expansion draft and terminated in accordance with the WNBA waiver procedure before the
first day of the Expansion Team's first Season shall not be included in the Expansion Team's

Article VII, Section 1(c).
(c) Assigned Contracts. For purposes of calculating Team Salary, with

74If at any time from December 1 through the day prior to the first
day of the Regular Season a Team has fewer than ten (10) players included in its Team Salary (as
determined in accordance with Section 2(d)(ii) below), then the Team's Team Salary shall be
increased by an amount calculated as follows:
STEP 1: Subtract from ten (10) the number of players included in
Team Salary.
STEP 2: If the result in Step 1 is a positive number, multiply the
result in Step 1 by the Rookie Minimum Annual Salary.
In determining whether a Team has fewer than ten (10) players
included in its Team Salary for purposes of Section 2(d)(i) above, the only players who shall be

75prior to July 1 of any Season, then, beginning on the second January 1 following the injury,
illness, or condition, the Team may apply to the WNBA to have the player's Salary for each
remaining Season of the Contract excluded from Team Salary. (For example, if the career-
ending injury, illness, or condition occurs on May 1, 2015, the Team may apply to have the
player's Salary excluded from Team Salary beginning on January 1, 2017.)
If the injury, illness, or condition occurs on or after July 1 but prior
to the subsequent January 1, then, beginning on the second anniversary of the injury, illness, or
condition, the Team may apply to the WNBA to have the player's Salary for each remaining
Season of the Contract excluded from Team Salary.
The determination of whether a player has suffered a career-ending
injury, illness, or condition, and the determination of the date on which a player's career-ending
injury, illness, or condition occurred, shall be made by a physician selected jointly by the WNBA
and the Players Association.
Notwithstanding subsections (i) through (iii) above or (viii) below,
a player's Salary shall not be excluded from Team Salary if, after the date on which a career-
ending injury, illness, or condition is alleged to have occurred but before her Salary is excluded
from Team Salary, the player played in more than five (5) WNBA games in any one (1) Season
or in a total of ten (10) games over two (2) Seasons.
Notwithstanding subsections (i) through (iii) above or (viii) below,
if, after a player's Salary is excluded from Team Salary in accordance with this Section 2(f), (i)
the player plays in five (5) WNBA games in any one (1) Season, the excluded Salary for that
Season and any subsequent Season shall thereupon be included in Team Salary; or (ii) the player
76in the first of such two (2) Seasons, the excluded Salary for the second Season shall thereupon be
included in Team Salary. If, at the time the player's Salary is required to be included again in
Team Salary in accordance with this Section 2(f)(v), the Team does not have Room for some or
all of such Salary, the portion of the player's Salary for which the Team has Room shall be
immediately included in the Team's Team Salary and the remainder shall be included in the
Team's Team Salary beginning on the earlier of (x) the next January 1, or (y) the earliest date
after such January 1 when the Team has Room for such remainder amount.
If a Team requests to have a player's Salary excluded from Team
Salary pursuant to this Section 2(f), the player with respect to whom the request is made shall
cooperate in the processing of the request, including by appearing (if necessary) at the scheduled
place and time for examination by a designated physician.
The exclusion from Team Salary authorized by this Section 2(f) is
available only to the Team with which the Disabled Player was under Contract at the time her
career-ending injury, illness, or condition occurs.
For purposes of this Section 2(f), the date of occurrence of a
career-ending injury, illness, or condition that has developed over time shall be deemed to be the
date on which the injury, illness, or condition progressed to the point of becoming career-ending.
(g) Training Camp Contracts. From February 1 until the day prior to the
first day of the next Regular Season, a Team may enter into Player Contracts that will not be
included in Team Salary until the first day of such Regular Season (i.e., the player will be
deemed not to have any Salary until the first day of such Regular Season), provided that such
Contracts satisfy the requirements of this Section 2(g) (a "Training Camp Contract"). No
77Salary, (ii) Base Salary protection of any kind, or (iii) a term longer than one (1) Season.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Rookie Scale Contract entered into from February 1 through
the day prior to the first day of the next Regular Season shall be a Training Camp Contract. The
only consideration that may be provided to a player signed to a Training Camp Contract, prior to
the start of the Regular Season, is per diem, lodging, and transportation. A Team that has
entered into one or more Training Camp Contracts must terminate such Contracts no later than
the day prior to the first day of a Regular Season, except to the extent the Team has Room for
such Contracts. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, Qualifying Offers and Rookie
Tenders that, if signed by the player would become Training Camp Contracts, shall not be
included in Team Salary from January 1 until the day prior to the first day of the next Regular
Season.
(h) Team Salary Summaries.
The WNBA shall provide the Players Association with Team
Salary summaries and a list of current Exceptions once every two weeks during the Regular
Season and once every week between February 1 and the commencement of the next Regular
Season.
In the event that the WNBA fails to provide the Players
Association with any Team Salary summary or list of Exceptions as provided for in Section
2(h)(i) above, the Players Association shall notify the WNBA of such failure, and the WNBA,
upon receipt of such notice, shall as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than two
business days following receipt of such notice, provide the Players Association with any such
summary or list that should have been provided pursuant to Section 2(h)(i) above.
78(a) Basic Rule. A Team's Team Salary may not exceed the Salary Cap at any
time unless the Team is using one of the Exceptions set forth in Section 4 below.
(b) Room. Subject to the other provisions of this Agreement, including
without limitation Article V, Section 8, any Team with Room may enter into a Player Contract
that calls for a Salary in the first Season of such Contract that would not exceed the Team's then-
current Room.

Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, for each Season
of a Player Contract after the first Season, the player's Salary may increase or decrease in
relation to the previous Season's Salary by no more than three percent (3%) of the Base Salary
for the first Season of the Contract.
With respect to an Extension (other than an Extension of a Rookie
Scale Contract), and notwithstanding Section 3(c)(i) above and 3(c)(iii) below, for each Season
of such Player Contract after the first Season of the extended term, the player's Salary may
increase or decrease in relation to the previous Season's Salary by no more than three percent
(3%) of the Base Salary for the last Season of the original term of the Contract.
With respect to an Extension of a Rookie Scale Contract, and
notwithstanding Section 3(c)(i) and 3(c)(ii) above, for each Season of such Player Contract after
the first Season of the extended term, the player's Salary may increase or decrease in relation to
the previous Season's Salary by no more than three percent (3%) of the Base Salary for the first
Season of the extended term of the Contract.

date of execution and shall be for a continuous term.
No Team and player may enter into a Player Contract during the
period commencing at the start of the Team's last game of the Regular Season and continuing
through the following January 31. The preceding sentence shall not prohibit a Team and player
from entering into an amendment to an existing Player Contract pursuant to Article V, Section
3(e) during such period.
Section 4. Hardship Exceptions to the Salary Cap.
There shall be the following exceptions to the rule that a Team's Team Salary
may not exceed the Salary Cap:
(a) Hardship.
If, during a WNBA Regular Season, a Team with one (1) player
who is unable to play due to injury, illness or other condition for a minimum of three additional
weeks from the date of the requested Exception (the "First Injured Player") has an additional
player (the "Disabled Player") who suffers a Disabling Injury, Illness, or Condition (as defined
below), the Team may sign one Replacement Player to a Replacement Contract to replace such
Disabled Player.
For purposes of this Section 4, Disabling Injury, Illness, or
Condition means any injury, illness, or condition that has rendered the Disabled Player unable to
play for a minimum of two (2) consecutive Regular Season games and will thereafter render the
Disabled Player unable to play for a minimum period of three (3) additional weeks (regardless of
80are fewer than three (3) weeks remaining in the WNBA Season).
A Hardship Exception will arise on the date it is granted by the
League Office and will expire seven (7) days after it arises.
The determination of whether a player has suffered a Disabling
Injury, Illness, or Condition shall be made by a physician designated by the WNBA (the
"WNBA Physician") in consultation with the Players Association, and such determination shall
be final, conclusive, and unappealable. The WNBA shall advise the Players Association of the
determination of the WNBA Physician within one (1) business day of such determination. The
cost of the WNBA Physician will be borne by the WNBA Team seeking the Exception.
In no event shall a Team be entitled to an Exception pursuant to
this Section 4(a), unless the First Injured Player on the date it applies for the Exception, in the
determination of the WNBA Physician, is unable to play for a minimum of three (3) additional
weeks from that date. The determination of the WNBA Physician shall be final, conclusive, and
unappealable. The cost of the WNBA Physician will be borne by the WNBA Team seeking the
Exception.
If a Team requests an Exception pursuant to this Section 4(a), the
player with respect to whom the request is made, and the First Injured Player, shall cooperate in
the processing of the request, including by appearing (if necessary) at the scheduled place and
time for examination by the WNBA Physician.
Notwithstanding a determination by the WNBA Physician that a
player has suffered a Disabling Injury, Illness, or Condition, such player, upon recovering from
81immediately terminate the Replacement Contract of the Replacement Player.
The Hardship Exception is available only to the Team with which
the Disabled Player was under Contract at the time her Disabling Injury, Illness, or Condition
occurred.
If a Team makes a request for a Hardship Exception to replace a
Disabled Player pursuant to this Section 4(a) and such request is denied, the Team shall not be
permitted to make any subsequent request for an Exception to replace the same player unless
fifteen (15) days have passed since the first request was denied and the Team establishes that the
subsequent request is based on a new injury or an aggravation of the same injury.
(b) Emergency Hardship.
If a Team during the Regular Season, as a result of injuries,
illnesses, other conditions or other extenuating circumstances that have affected its players, has
fewer than ten (10) players on its roster who are able to play, it may apply to the WNBA to
obtain an Exception to sign one or more Replacement Player(s) to Replacement Contract(s) to
replace one or more of the Team's unavailable Players. Any such Replacement Contract shall be
terminated immediately once ten (10) other players on the Team's roster are again able to play.
The determination of whether to grant a Team one or more
Emergency Hardship Exceptions shall be in the WNBA's sole discretion. The WNBA may
attach such conditions to an Emergency Hardship Exception as it may determine, in its sole
discretion, provided that such conditions do not violate any provision of this Agreement.
If a Team requests an Emergency Hardship Exception pursuant to
this Section 4(b), all players whom the Team claims are unable to play shall cooperate in the
82the WNBA may require for purposes of determining when a Replacement Contract must be
terminated pursuant to Section 4(b)(i) above), including by appearing (if necessary) at the
scheduled place(s) and time(s) for examination(s) by a physician designated by the WNBA. The
cost of the WNBA physician will be borne by the WNBA Team seeking the Exception.

accordance with Article V, Section 3(e), then for purposes of calculating the player's Salary for
the then-current and any remaining Salary Cap Year, the aggregate reduction in the player's
protected Base Salary shall be allocated pro rata over the then-current and each remaining Salary
84(prior to giving effect to such reduction) in each such Salary Cap Year.
