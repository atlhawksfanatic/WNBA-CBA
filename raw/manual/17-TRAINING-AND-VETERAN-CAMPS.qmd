 ARTICLE XVII
TRAINING AND VETERAN CAMPS
Section 1. Training Camp.
(a) Training camps will open on a date specified by the Commissioner that
will not be more than thirty (30) days before the first day of any Regular Season. Prior to each
WNBA Regular Season, the WNBA shall advise the Players Association of the expected start
date ("Expected Start Date") of the training camp for the following WNBA Regular Season. If
the actual start date for any training camp beginning with the 2021 training camp commences
earlier than the date that is one week prior to the applicable Expected Start Date, then the
Additional Unpaid Team Promotional Appearance penalty for a player missing all or any part of
the first seven (7) days of training camp pursuant to Article XIV, Section 8, shall not be
applicable for such training camp.
Players invited to attend training camp will receive a meal expense allowance as
set forth in Article XI, Section 3, housing accommodations as set forth in Article XI, Section 1,
and reimbursement for any transportation expenses actually incurred from their home cities
(provided such expenses are documented to the Team and are ordinary and reasonable).
Section 2. Veteran Camp.
The WNBA may hold a Veteran skills and conditioning camp during any Off-
Season covered under this Agreement. If such a camp is held, a Veteran may participate on a
voluntary basis if she is invited by the WNBA to do so. The compensation to be provided to
participating players shall be limited to the prior Season's meal expense allowance during each
day of the camp as set forth in Article XI, Section 3, single hotel accommodations, and
reimbursement for any transportation expenses actually incurred (provided such expenses are
documented to the WNBA and are ordinary and reasonable).
